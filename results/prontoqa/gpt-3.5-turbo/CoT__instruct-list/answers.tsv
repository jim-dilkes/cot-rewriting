8. Protostomes are invertebrates.
9. Each invertebrate is an animal.
10. Each arthropod is a protostome.
11. Insects are arthropods.
12. Stella is a painted lady.

Based on the given information, we can conclude the following:

1. Stella is a painted lady, which is a butterfly.
2. Butterflies are lepidopterans.
3. Lepidopterans are insects.
4. Insects are arthropods.
5. Arthropods are segmented.

Therefore, the statement ""Stella is not segmented"" is false."	false	false	1

Mersenne primes are prime numbers. Every prime number is not composite. Real numbers are numbers. Prime numbers are natural numbers. Natural numbers are integers. 127 is a natural number.
True or false: 127 is not real."	"1. Every natural number is not negative. (True)
2. Each Mersenne prime is not composite. (True)
3. Real numbers are real. (True)
4. Each imaginary number is not real. (True)

6. Mersenne primes are prime numbers. (True)
7. Every prime number is not composite. (True)
8. Real numbers are numbers. (True)
9. Prime numbers are natural numbers. (True)
10. Natural numbers are integers. (True)

Based on the given information, we can conclude that 127 is a natural number. Since natural numbers are integers, and integers are real numbers, we can also conclude that 127 is a real number.

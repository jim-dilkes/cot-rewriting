Each mammal is a vertebrate. (True)\n9. Felines are carnivores. (True)\n10. Every snake is not furry. (True)\n11. Tabbies are cats. (True)\n12. Mammals are furry. (True)\n\nGiven that Sally is a tabby, we can conclude that Sally is a cat. Since cats are mammals and mammals are furry, it is true that Sally is furry.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Sally is furry\" is true."

Mersenne primes are not composite. Prime numbers are prime. Prime numbers are natural numbers. Each natural number is positive. Real numbers are numbers. Each real number is not imaginary. 7 is a prime number.\nTrue or false: 7 is imaginary.\n\nSolution: First, we need to understand the definitions of imaginary and prime numbers.\n\nAn imaginary number is a complex number that can be written as a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit \"i\". It is represented as a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. Every complex number is imaginary. - False. Complex numbers can be either real or imaginary. For example, 3 + 0i is a complex number but not imaginary.\n\n2. Integers are real numbers. - True. Integers are a subset of real numbers.\n\n3. Mersenne primes are prime numbers. - True. Mersenne primes are a specific type of prime numbers that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer.\n\n4. Natural numbers are integers. - True. Natural numbers are a subset of integers.\n\n5. Mersenne primes are not composite. - True. Mersenne primes, by definition, are prime numbers and prime numbers are not composite.\n\n6. Prime numbers are prime. - True. Prime numbers are defined as numbers that have no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n7. Prime numbers are natural numbers. - True. Prime numbers are a subset of natural numbers.\n\n8. Each natural number is positive. - True. Natural numbers are defined as positive integers.\n\n9. Real numbers are numbers. - True. Real numbers include both rational and irrational numbers.\n\n10. Each real number is not imaginary. - True. Real numbers can be either real or complex, but if they are complex, they are not purely imaginary.\n\nBased on these evaluations, we can conclude that the statement \"7 is imaginary\" is False. 7 is a prime number and prime numbers are not imaginary."

However, we don't have any information about whether 131071 is a complex number or not. So, we cannot determine whether 131071 is imaginary or not based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine whether the statement \"131071 is not imaginary\" is true or false based on the given information."

Real numbers are numbers. - True\n   Real numbers are a subset of numbers that include rational and irrational numbers.\n\n3. Real numbers are not imaginary. - True\n   Real numbers do not have an imaginary part, so they are not imaginary.\n\n4. Each natural number is an integer. - True\n   Natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) are a subset of integers.\n\n5. Prime numbers are not composite. - True\n   Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves, while composite numbers have additional divisors.\n\n6. Integers are real numbers. - True\n   Integers are a subset of real numbers.\n\n7. Each Mersenne prime is a prime number. - True\n   Mersenne primes are prime numbers that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer.\n\n8. Each Mersenne prime is prime. - True\n   This statement is the same as statement 7.\n\n9. Prime numbers are natural numbers. - True\n   Prime numbers are a subset of natural numbers.\n\n10. Natural numbers are positive. - True\n    Natural numbers are positive whole numbers (excluding zero).\n\n11. 8191 is a Mersenne prime. - True\n    8191 is a prime number and can be written as 2^13 - 1, which makes it a Mersenne prime.\n\nBased on the given statements, we can conclude that the statement \"8191 is not imaginary\" is True."

Every cat is a feline. Every snake is not furry. Felines are carnivores. Each vertebrate is a chordate. Every mammal is furry. Carnivores are carnivorous. Sally is a cat.\nTrue or false: Sally is not furry.\n\nSolution: According to the given information:\n\n1. Each bilaterian is an animal.\n2. Each carnivore is a mammal.\n3. Mammals are vertebrates.\n4. Animals are not unicellular.\n5. Chordates are bilaterians.\n6. Every cat is a feline.\n7. Every snake is not furry.\n8. Felines are carnivores.\n9. Each vertebrate is a chordate.\n10. Every mammal is furry.\n11. Carnivores are carnivorous.\n\nGiven that Sally is a cat, we can conclude that she is a feline (from statement 6). Since felines are carnivores (from statement 8), we can also conclude that Sally is a carnivore.\n\nNow, according to statement 2, each carnivore is a mammal. Therefore, Sally is also a mammal.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that mammals are vertebrates. So, Sally is also a vertebrate.\n\nFinally, from statement 10, we know that every mammal is furry. Therefore, Sally, being a mammal, is indeed furry.\n\nSo, the statement \"Sally is not furry\" is false. Sally is furry."

Since wren is an insect (a butterfly), it does not have eight legs.\n\nBased on the information given, we can conclude that the statement \"Wren is not eight-legged\" is true.",

However, it is stated that every mammal is not cold-blooded, so Fae is not cold-blooded.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Fae is not cold-blooded\" is true."

Mersenne primes are prime numbers: This statement is redundant, as it is already stated in the first statement. Therefore, it is true.\n\n4. Each real number is a number: This statement is true.

Real numbers include all rational and irrational numbers, and they are not considered imaginary.\n\n7. Natural numbers are integers: This statement is true. Natural numbers are a subset of integers, specifically the positive integers (including zero).\n\n8. Complex numbers are imaginary: This statement is false. Complex numbers include both real and imaginary parts. They can be written in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit.\n\n9.

Each painted lady is a butterfly. Insects are arthropods. Butterflies are lepidopterans. Protostomes are invertebrates. Arthropods are protostomes. Every animal is multicellular. Wren is a painted lady.\nTrue or false: Wren is bony.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine whether Wren is bony or not based on the given statements. \n\nTo approach this problem, I would analyze the statements and their relationships to determine the characteristics of Wren and whether it is bony or not. I would follow the logical connections between the statements and use deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion.\n\nSolution: Based on the given statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. Every lepidopteran is an insect.\n2. Insects are not eight-legged.\n3. Whales are bony.\n4. Arthropods are not bony.\n5. Invertebrates are animals.\n6. Each painted lady is a butterfly.\n7. Insects are arthropods.\n8. Butterflies are lepidopterans.\n9. Protostomes are invertebrates.\n10. Arthropods are protostomes.\n11. Every animal is multicellular.\n12. Wren is a painted lady.\n\nFrom statement 6, we know that each painted lady is a butterfly. From statement 8, we know that butterflies are lepidopterans. From statement 1, we know that every lepidopteran is an insect. Therefore, we can conclude that Wren is an insect.\n\nFrom statement 7, we know that insects are arthropods. From statement 10, we know that arthropods are protostomes. From statement 9, we know that protostomes are invertebrates. Therefore, we can conclude that Wren is an invertebrate.\n\nFrom statement 11, we know that every animal is multicellular. Since Wren is an animal (as concluded from the previous deductions), we can conclude that Wren is multicellular.\n\nHowever, there is no direct statement or logical connection that allows us to determine whether Wren is bony or not. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Wren is bony based on the given statements."

Each prime number is a natural number. Every real number is not imaginary. Each integer is a real number. Each prime number is prime. Every Mersenne prime is prime. Complex numbers are imaginary. 127 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 127 is imaginary.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine whether the statement \"127 is imaginary\" is true or false. \n\nTo approach this problem, I would use the given information and definitions to determine the nature of the number 127. Specifically, I would consider the definitions of natural numbers, Mersenne primes, real numbers, and imaginary numbers.\n\nSolution: Based on the given information and definitions, we can determine the nature of the number 127.\n\nFirst, we know that every natural number is positive, and each natural number is an integer. Therefore, 127 is a natural number and an integer.\n\nNext, we know that every Mersenne prime is a prime number. However, it is not stated whether 127 is a Mersenne prime or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether 127 is a Mersenne prime.\n\nMoving on, we know that each prime number is a natural number. Since 127 is a prime number (it cannot be divided evenly by any other number except 1 and itself), we can conclude that 127 is a natural number.\n\nLastly, we know that each integer is a real number. Therefore, 127 is a real number.\n\nBased on the given information and definitions, we can conclude that 127 is a natural number, an integer, and a real number. However, it is not stated whether 127 is an imaginary number or not. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the statement \"127 is imaginary\" is true or false."

Every natural number is positive. Each real number is a number. Natural numbers are integers. Mersenne primes are prime numbers. Mersenne primes are prime. Every real number is not imaginary. 127 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 127 is imaginary.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine whether the statement \"127 is imaginary\" is true or false. To approach this problem, I would use the given information and definitions to evaluate the statement.\n\nSolution: Based on the given information and definitions, we can determine whether the statement \"127 is imaginary\" is true or false.\n\nFirst, let's review the definitions:\n\n- Complex numbers: Complex numbers are numbers that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit (\u221a-1).\n- Imaginary numbers: Imaginary numbers are complex numbers where the real part is 0, i.e., a + 0i.\n- Mersenne primes: Mersenne primes are prime numbers that can be expressed in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statement:\n\n- 127 is a Mersenne prime: This statement is true. 127 can be expressed as 2^7 - 1, where 7 is a positive integer. Therefore, 127 is a Mersenne prime.\n- Mersenne primes are prime numbers: This statement is true. By definition, Mersenne primes are prime numbers that can be expressed in the form 2^n - 1.\n- Every prime number is not composite: This statement is true. By definition, prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves, while composite numbers have additional divisors.\n- Complex numbers are imaginary: This statement is false. Complex numbers can have both a real and imaginary part, while imaginary numbers have a real part of 0.\n- Every real number is not imaginary: This statement is true. Real numbers can have a non-zero real part, while imaginary numbers have a real part of 0.\n\nBased on the above evaluations, we can conclude that the statement \"127 is imaginary\" is false."

Fae is a cat.\nTrue or false: Fae is not herbivorous.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine whether Fae is herbivorous or not based on the given statements. \n\nTo approach this problem, I would analyze the statements and their relationships to determine the characteristics of Fae and whether it is herbivorous or not. I would consider the statements about mammals, carnivores, felines, and herbivores to draw conclusions about Fae's dietary habits.\n\nSolution: Based on the given statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n1. Every vertebrate is an animal.\n2. Every animal is not unicellular.\n3. Mammals are not cold-blooded.\n4. Mammals are vertebrates.\n5. Each cat is a feline.\n6. Each sheep is herbivorous.\n7. Carnivores are not herbivorous.\n8. Felines are carnivores.\n9. Each carnivore is a mammal.\n10. Fae is a cat.\n\nFrom statement 6, we know that each sheep is herbivorous. However, there is no direct statement about Fae being a sheep. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Fae is herbivorous or not based on the given statements.\n\nThe answer to the question \"True or false: Fae is not herbivorous\" is: We cannot determine whether Fae is herbivorous or not based on the given statements."

By following the logical deductions, I can determine whether Sam, being a butterfly, is bony or not.\n\nSolution: Based on the given statements and logical deductions, we can determine whether Sam, who is a butterfly, is bony or not.\n\n1. Every animal is not unicellular.\n2. Each butterfly is a lepidopteran.\n3. Invertebrates are animals.\n4. Arthropods are invertebrates.\n5. Whales are bony.\n6. Every lepidopteran is an insect.\n7. Insects are not eight-legged.\n8. Arthropods are not bony.\n9. Each insect is an arthropod.\n10. Sam is a butterfly.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Sam is a lepidopteran. From statement 6, we know that every lepidopteran is an insect. From statement 9, we know that each insect is an arthropod. \n\nHowever, from statement 8, we know that arthropods are not bony. Therefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that Sam, being a butterfly (which is an insect and an arthropod), is not bony.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: False, Sam is not bony."

Every insect is six-legged.\n2. Every arthropod is an invertebrate.\n3. Whales are not small.\n4. Each butterfly is a lepidopteran.\n5. Arthropods are small.\n6. Lepidopterans are insects.\n7. Each insect is an arthropod.\n8. Every invertebrate is an animal.\n9. Animals are multicellular.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that Polly is a lepidopteran. From statement 6, we know that lepidopterans are insects. From statement 7, we know that each insect is an arthropod. From statement 2, we know that every arthropod is an invertebrate. From statement 8, we know that every invertebrate is an animal.\n\nSince Polly is an insect, an arthropod, and an invertebrate, we can conclude that Polly is also an animal. From statement 9, we know that animals are multicellular.\n\nHowever, there is no direct statement that indicates the size of Polly. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Polly is small or not based on the given statements. The answer to the question \"Polly is not small\" is indeterminate."

Each invertebrate is an animal.\n2. Lepidopterans are insects.\n3. Each nematode is not segmented.\n4. Every arthropod is segmented.\n5. Each butterfly is a lepidopteran.\n6. Insects are six-legged.\n7. Animals are multicellular.\n8. Each arthropod is an invertebrate.\n9. Insects are arthropods.\n\nFrom statement 5, we know that Fae is a butterfly. From statement 3, we know that nematodes are not segmented. From statement 4, we know that arthropods are segmented. From statement 9, we know that insects are arthropods.\n\nSince Fae is a butterfly and butterflies are insects, and insects are arthropods, and arthropods are segmented, we can conclude that Fae, being a butterfly, is indeed segmented.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Fae is not segmented\" is false."

According to the given information, complex numbers are imaginary. Therefore, if 8191 is not a complex number, it cannot be imaginary.\n\nNext, let's consider the definition of a complex number. Complex numbers are numbers that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit (\u221a-1). However, there is no information given that directly states whether 8191 is a complex number or not.\n\nMoving on, let's consider the definition of a real number. According to the given information, real numbers are numbers. Therefore, if 8191 is a number, it must be a real number.\n\nLastly, let's consider the definition of an imaginary number again.

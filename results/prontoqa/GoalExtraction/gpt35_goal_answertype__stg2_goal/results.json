However, there is no direct information stating whether 131071 is imaginary or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine whether 131071 is imaginary based on the given information."

Max is a butterfly.\nTrue or false: Max is not eight-legged.\n\n- The goal of this problem is to determine whether Max is eight-legged or not.\n- The expected answer is either \"True\" or \"False\".\n\nSolution: Step 1: Arthropods are invertebrates. \n- This means that arthropods do not have a backbone or spinal column.\n\nStep 2: Butterflies are lepidopterans. \n- Lepidopterans are a specific group of insects that include butterflies and moths.\n\nStep 3: Every insect is not eight-legged. \n- This means that not all insects have eight legs.\n\nStep 4: Each spider is eight-legged. \n- Spiders are a specific group of arthropods that have eight legs.\n\nStep 5: Insects are arthropods. \n- This means that all insects belong to the larger group of arthropods.\n\nStep 6: Lepidopterans are insects. \n- This means that butterflies, being lepidopterans, are also insects.\n\nStep 7: Every arthropod is small. \n- This statement implies that all arthropods are small in size.\n\nStep 8: Each invertebrate is an animal. \n- Invertebrates are animals that do not have a backbone or spinal column.\n\nStep 9: Animals are multicellular. \n- This means that all animals are made up of multiple cells.\n\nStep 10: Max is a butterfly. \n- This statement tells us that Max is a specific individual belonging to the butterfly species.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that Max is not eight-legged. \n- This is because butterflies, including Max, are insects, and not all insects have eight legs. Therefore, the answer is \"True\"."

Imaginary numbers do not have a real part (a = 0) and have a non-zero imaginary part (b \u2260 0).\n\nGiven that 131071 is a natural number, we know that it is a positive integer. However, we do not have any information about its imaginary part.\n\nSince we do not have any information about the imaginary part of 131071, we cannot definitively say whether it is imaginary or not.

Each integer is a real number. Every prime number is a natural number. Every real number is not imaginary. Each complex number is imaginary. Each Mersenne prime is not composite. Real numbers are numbers. 31 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 31 is imaginary.\n\n- The goal of this problem is to determine whether 31 is imaginary.\n- The expected answer is either true or false.\n\nSolution: To determine whether 31 is imaginary, we need to consider the definitions and properties of imaginary numbers.\n\n1. Every prime number is a natural number. (True)\n2. Every natural number is an integer. (True)\n3. Each Mersenne prime is a prime number. (True)\n4. Every natural number is positive. (True)\n5. Each integer is a real number. (True)\n6. Every prime number is a natural number. (True)\n7. Every real number is not imaginary. (True)\n8. Each complex number is imaginary. (False)\n9. Each Mersenne prime is not composite. (True)\n10. Real numbers are numbers. (True)\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that 31, being a prime number, is a natural number, an integer, and a real number. Since it is not a complex number, it is not imaginary.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"31 is imaginary\" is false."

Integers are a subset of real numbers.\n\n- Each Mersenne prime is a prime number: This statement is true. Mersenne primes are prime numbers that can be expressed in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer.\n\n- Each Mersenne prime is prime: This statement is redundant and does not provide any new information. It is true by definition.\n\n- Prime numbers are natural numbers: This statement is true. Prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1.\n\n- Natural numbers are positive: This statement is true. Natural numbers are positive integers greater than or equal to 1.\n\n- 8191 is a Mersenne prime: This statement is true. 8191 can be expressed as 2^13 - 1, where 13 is a positive integer.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that 8191 is not imaginary. Therefore, the answer is false."

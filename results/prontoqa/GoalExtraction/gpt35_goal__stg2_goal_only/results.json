Rex is a butterfly.\nTrue or false: Rex is not eight-legged.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine whether Rex, who is a butterfly, is eight-legged or not based on the given information.\n\nSolution: Step 1: Arthropods are invertebrates. \nThis means that all arthropods do not have a backbone.\n\nStep 2: Every spider is eight-legged. \nThis means that all spiders have eight legs.\n\nStep 3: Each invertebrate is an animal. \nThis means that all invertebrates are animals.\n\nStep 4: Every insect is not eight-legged. \nThis means that insects do not have eight legs.\n\nStep 5: Insects are arthropods. \nThis means that all insects are arthropods.\n\nStep 6: Each lepidopteran is an insect. \nThis means that all lepidopterans are insects.\n\nStep 7: Animals are multicellular. \nThis means that all animals are made up of multiple cells.\n\nStep 8: Arthropods are segmented. \nThis means that all arthropods have segmented bodies.\n\nStep 9: Every butterfly is a lepidopteran. \nThis means that all butterflies are lepidopterans.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that Rex, who is a butterfly, is not eight-legged. This is because every insect is not eight-legged, and butterflies are a type of insect."

Chordates are bilaterians. Every vertebrate is a chordate. Cats are felines. Every animal is multicellular. Felines are carnivores. Mammals are vertebrates. Fae is a cat.\nTrue or false: Fae is not warm-blooded.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine whether Fae is warm-blooded or not based on the given statements.\n\nSolution: Based on the given statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n1. Every carnivore is a mammal.\n2. Snakes are not warm-blooded.\n3. Carnivores are carnivorous.\n4. Each mammal is warm-blooded.\n5. Bilaterians are animals.\n6. Chordates are bilaterians.\n7. Every vertebrate is a chordate.\n8. Cats are felines.\n9. Every animal is multicellular.\n10. Felines are carnivores.\n11. Mammals are vertebrates.\n12. Fae is a cat.\n\nTo determine whether Fae is warm-blooded or not, we need to analyze the statements and their logical connections.\n\nStatement 1 tells us that every carnivore is a mammal. Since Fae is a cat (Statement 12) and cats are felines (Statement 8), and felines are carnivores (Statement 10), we can conclude that Fae is a carnivore and therefore a mammal.\n\nStatement 4 states that each mammal is warm-blooded. Since Fae is a mammal, we can conclude that Fae is warm-blooded.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Fae is not warm-blooded\" is false. Fae is indeed warm-blooded based on the given statements."

Fae is a cat.\n\nTo determine whether Fae is herbivorous or not, we need to consider the statements related to Fae and herbivorous animals.\n\nStatement 6 states that each sheep is herbivorous, but Fae is not a sheep, so this statement does not provide any information about Fae.\n\nStatement 8 states that felines are carnivores. Since Fae is a cat, this statement applies to Fae.\n\nStatement 7 states that carnivores are not herbivorous. Since Fae is a carnivore (based on statement 8), this means that Fae is not herbivorous.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, the statement \"Fae is not herbivorous\" is true."

Polly is a lepidopteran.\n\nFrom statement 6, we know that lepidopterans are insects. From statement 7, we know that each insect is an arthropod. Therefore, lepidopterans are also arthropods.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that every arthropod is an invertebrate. From statement 8, we know that every invertebrate is an animal. Therefore, arthropods are also animals.\n\nFrom statement 5, we know that arthropods are small.\n\nFrom statement 10, we know that Polly is a lepidopteran.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that Polly is an arthropod, which means she is also an animal. Since arthropods are small (statement 5), we can infer that Polly is small.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Polly is not small\" is false. Polly is small.",

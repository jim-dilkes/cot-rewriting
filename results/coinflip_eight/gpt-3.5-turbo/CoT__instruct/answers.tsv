Lucia flips the coin. Is the coin still heads up? Note that 'flip' here means 'reverse'.	"Sure! Let's go through each person's action and determine the state of the coin after each flip.

1. Rahul flips the coin: Since the coin was initially heads up, flipping it would reverse its state, making it tails up.

2. Sanne does not flip the coin: Since Sanne does not flip the coin, its state remains the same, which is tails up.

3. Ryan flips the coin: Since the coin was tails up, flipping it would reverse its state, making it heads up again.

4. Andrew flips the coin: Since the coin was heads up, flipping it would reverse its state, making it tails up.

5. Marc flips the coin: Since the coin was tails up, flipping it would reverse its state, making it heads up again.

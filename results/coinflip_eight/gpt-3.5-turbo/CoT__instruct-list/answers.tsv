If we assume that the coin starts with heads up, then after an odd number of flips, it will end up with tails up. Conversely, after an even number of flips, it will end up with heads up.

In this case, the coin has been flipped 5 times, which is an odd number. Therefore, the final state of the coin will be tails up."	tails	tails	1

Based on the given information, the coin was initially heads up and there were a total of 4 flips. 

Since Rini, Camille, Henk, and Teresa flipped the coin, we need to consider the effect of these flips on the initial state of the coin.

If we assume that each flip reverses the current state of the coin, then the coin would be flipped 4 times, resulting in a total of 4 reversals.

Since an even number of reversals would bring the coin back to its original state, and 4 is an even number, the coin would still be heads up after all the flips.

Therefore, based on the given information, the coin is still heads up."	heads	heads	1

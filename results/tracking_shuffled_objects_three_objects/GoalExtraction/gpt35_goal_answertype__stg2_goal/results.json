At the start of the dance, Alice is dancing with Melissa, Bob is dancing with Sam, and Claire is dancing with Karl.\n\n2. The first switch is between Bob and Alice. So now Alice is dancing with Sam, and Bob is dancing with Melissa. Claire's partner remains the same.\n\n3. The second switch is between Claire and Alice. Since Alice is currently dancing with Sam, she will now dance with Karl. Bob's partner remains the same.\n\n4. The final switch is between Bob and Alice again.

Start with the initial book assignments:\n   - Alice has Catch-22\n   - Bob has Lolita\n   - Claire has Hound of the Baskervilles\n\n2. First swap: Bob and Alice swap books:\n   - Alice now has Lolita\n   - Bob now has Catch-22\n   - Claire still has Hound of the Baskervilles\n\n3. Second swap: Bob and Claire swap books:\n   - Alice still has Lolita\n   - Bob now has Hound of the Baskervilles\n   - Claire now has Catch-22\n\n4. Third swap: Alice and Claire swap books:\n   - Alice now has Catch-22\n   - Bob still has Hound of the Baskervilles\n   - Claire now has Lolita\n\n5. At the end of the semester, Bob has the book \"Hound of the Baskervilles\".\n\nSo, the answer is \"Hound of the Baskervilles\"."

At the end of the match, Claire is playing \n\n- The goal of this problem is to determine the position Claire is playing at the end of the match.\n- The expected answer is the position Claire is playing at the end of the match.\n\nSolution: Sure! Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start: Alice is playing cheerleader, Bob is playing right winger, and Claire is playing fullback.\n\n2. First swap: Claire and Alice trade positions.\n   - After the first swap, Alice is playing fullback, Bob is playing right winger, and Claire is playing cheerleader.\n\n3. Second swap: Bob and Claire trade positions.\n   - After the second swap, Alice is playing fullback, Claire is playing right winger, and Bob is playing cheerleader.\n\n4. Third swap: Claire and Alice trade positions again.\n   - After the third swap, Claire is playing fullback, Alice is playing right winger, and Bob is playing cheerleader.\n\nSo, at the end of the match, Claire is playing the fullback position."

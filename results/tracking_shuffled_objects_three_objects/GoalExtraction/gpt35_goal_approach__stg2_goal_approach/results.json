At the end of the semester, Alice has  \n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which book Alice has at the end of the semester after the book trades. \n\nTo approach this problem, I would keep track of the book swaps and update the ownership of the books accordingly.\n\nSolution: To keep track of the book swaps and update the ownership, we can create variables to represent the ownership of each book. Let's use the following variables:\n\n- aliceBook: represents the book owned by Alice\n- bobBook: represents the book owned by Bob\n- claireBook: represents the book owned by Claire\n\nInitially, we know that Alice has The Great Gatsby, Bob has Ulysses, and Claire has Moby Dick. So, we can set the initial values of the variables as follows:\n\naliceBook = \"The Great Gatsby\"\nbobBook = \"Ulysses\"\nclaireBook = \"Moby Dick\"\n\nNow, let's go through the book swaps one by one and update the ownership accordingly:\n\n1. Alice and Claire swap books:\n   - Alice gives \"The Great Gatsby\" to Claire.\n   - Claire gives \"Moby Dick\" to Alice.\n   - Update the variables:\n     - aliceBook = \"Moby Dick\"\n     - claireBook = \"The Great Gatsby\"\n\n2. Bob and Claire swap books:\n   - Bob gives \"Ulysses\" to Claire.\n   - Claire gives \"The Great Gatsby\" to Bob.\n   - Update the variables:\n     - bobBook = \"The Great Gatsby\"\n     - claireBook = \"Ulysses\"\n\n3. Alice and Claire swap books:\n   - Alice gives \"Moby Dick\" to Claire.\n   - Claire gives \"Ulysses\" to Alice.\n   - Update the variables:\n     - aliceBook = \"Ulysses\"\n     - claireBook = \"Moby Dick\"\n\nAt the end of the semester, Alice has \"Ulysses\" as her book.\n\nTherefore, the book Alice has at the end of the semester is \"Ulysses\"."

At the end of the semester, Alice has  \n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which book Alice has at the end of the semester after the series of book swaps. \n\nTo approach this problem, I would track the book swaps step by step and keep a record of which book each person has at each stage. By following the given sequence of swaps, I can determine the final book that Alice has.\n\nSolution: Let's track the book swaps step by step:\n\n1. Alice and Claire swap books:\n   - Alice gives The Fellowship of the Ring to Claire.\n   - Claire gives The Great Gatsby to Alice.\n   - Alice now has The Great Gatsby, and Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring.\n   - Bob still has The Odyssey.\n\n2. Alice and Bob swap books:\n   - Alice gives The Great Gatsby to Bob.\n   - Bob gives The Odyssey to Alice.\n   - Alice now has The Odyssey, and Bob has The Great Gatsby.\n   - Claire still has The Fellowship of the Ring.\n\n3. Claire and Alice swap books:\n   - Claire gives The Fellowship of the Ring to Alice.\n   - Alice gives The Odyssey to Claire.\n   - Alice now has The Fellowship of the Ring, and Claire has The Odyssey.\n   - Bob still has The Great Gatsby.\n\nTherefore, at the end of the semester, Alice has The Fellowship of the Ring."

At the end of the semester, Claire has  \n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which book Claire has at the end of the semester after the book trades. \n\nTo approach this problem, I would keep track of the book swaps and update the ownership of the books accordingly. I would start with the initial ownership of the books and then follow the sequence of swaps to determine the final ownership of each book. Finally, I would identify which book Claire has at the end of the semester.\n\nSolution: To determine which book Claire has at the end of the semester, let's start by keeping track of the book swaps and updating the ownership of the books accordingly.\n\nInitial ownership:\nAlice: Lolita\nBob: Catch-22\nClaire: The Great Gatsby\n\nFirst swap: Alice and Claire\nAlice gives Lolita to Claire, and Claire gives The Great Gatsby to Alice.\nUpdated ownership:\nAlice: The Great Gatsby\nBob: Catch-22\nClaire: Lolita\n\nSecond swap: Bob and Alice\nBob gives Catch-22 to Alice, and Alice gives The Great Gatsby to Bob.\nUpdated ownership:\nAlice: Catch-22\nBob: The Great Gatsby\nClaire: Lolita\n\nThird swap: Claire and Alice\nClaire gives Lolita to Alice, and Alice gives Catch-22 to Claire.\nUpdated ownership:\nAlice: Lolita\nBob: The Great Gatsby\nClaire: Catch-22\n\nAt the end of the semester, Claire has the book Catch-22."

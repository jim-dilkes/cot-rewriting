Let's break down the steps to determine which book Claire has at the end of the semester:\n\nStep 1: Identify the initial books each person has:\n- Alice has The Great Gatsby\n- Bob has The Odyssey\n- Claire has Lolita\n\nStep 2: Determine the book swaps that occur:\n- Alice and Bob swap books: Alice gives The Great Gatsby to Bob, and Bob gives The Odyssey to Alice.\n- Alice and Claire swap books: Alice gives The Odyssey to Claire, and Claire gives Lolita to Alice.\n- Bob and Claire swap books: Bob gives The Great Gatsby to Claire, and Claire gives The Odyssey to Bob.\n\nStep 3: Determine the final books each person has:\n- Alice has Lolita (received from Claire)\n- Bob has The Odyssey (received from Claire)\n- Claire has The Great Gatsby (received from Bob)\n\nTherefore, at the end of the semester, Claire has The Great Gatsby."

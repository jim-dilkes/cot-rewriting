So now, Claire is playing goalkeeper and Alice is playing right midfielder. Bob's position remains unchanged as the left winger.\n\n3. The second swap occurs between Bob and Claire. Now, Claire is playing left winger, Alice is still playing right midfielder, and Bob is playing goalkeeper.\n\n4. Finally, the last swap occurs between Alice and Bob.

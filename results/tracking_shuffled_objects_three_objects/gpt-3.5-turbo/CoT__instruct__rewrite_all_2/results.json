Let's go through the solution again:\n\nStep 1: Claire and Alice trade positions.\nInitially, Alice is the goalkeeper and Claire is the striker. After they trade positions, Alice becomes the striker and Claire becomes the goalkeeper. Bob's position remains unchanged as the left midfielder.\n\nStep 2: Alice and Bob trade positions.\nAfter the first swap, Alice is the striker and Bob is the left midfielder. When they trade positions, Alice becomes the left midfielder and Bob becomes the striker. Claire's position remains unchanged as the goalkeeper.\n\nStep 3: Bob and Claire trade positions.\nAfter the second swap, Alice is the left midfielder, Bob is the striker, and Claire is the goalkeeper. When Bob and Claire trade positions, Bob becomes the goalkeeper and Claire becomes the striker. Alice's position remains unchanged as the left midfielder.\n\nSo, at the end of the match, Bob is playing goalkeeper.\nAnswer: goalkeeper"

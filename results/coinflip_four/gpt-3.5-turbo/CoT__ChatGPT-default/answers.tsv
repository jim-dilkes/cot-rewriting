0	A coin is heads up. Martha does not flip the coin. Audrey flips the coin. Ashley does not flip the coin. Marcia does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up? Note that 'flip' here means 'reverse'.	"Initially, the coin is heads up. 

Martha does not flip the coin, so the orientation of the coin remains the same.

Audrey flips the coin. Since the coin was initially heads up, flipping it would reverse its orientation, making it tails up.

Ashley does not flip the coin, so the orientation remains the same as Audrey flipped it, which is tails up.

Marcia does not flip the coin, so the orientation remains the same as Ashley flipped it, which is tails up.

Therefore, after all the actions, the coin is tails up, not heads up."	tails	tails	1

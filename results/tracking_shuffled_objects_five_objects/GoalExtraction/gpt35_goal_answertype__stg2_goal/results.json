Let's go step by step to determine which book Dave has at the end of the semester.\n\n1. At the start of the semester, Dave has the book \"Hound of the Baskervilles\".\n\n2. Dave and Claire swap books. So now Dave has Claire's book, which is \"Ulysses\".\n\n3. Claire and Eve swap books. Since Dave has Claire's book, he now has Eve's book, which is \"Moby Dick\".\n\n4. Alice and Claire swap books. Dave still has Eve's book, \"Moby Dick\".\n\n5. Claire and Bob swap books. Dave still has Eve's book, \"Moby Dick\".\n\n6. Finally, Dave and Eve swap books. Since Dave has Eve's book, he now has his original book, \"Hound of the Baskervilles\", back.\n\nTherefore, at the end of the semester, Dave has \"Hound of the Baskervilles\"."

At the end of the match, Bob is playing \n\n- The goal of this problem is to determine the position Bob is playing at the end of the match.\n- The expected answer is the position Bob is playing at the end of the match.\n\nSolution: Sure! Let's break down the position swaps and track Bob's position at each step:\n\n1. Eve and Bob trade positions:\n   - Alice: left winger\n   - Bob: center midfielder\n   - Claire: left midfielder\n   - Dave: fullback\n   - Eve: goalkeeper\n\n2. Dave and Alice trade positions:\n   - Alice: fullback\n   - Bob: center midfielder\n   - Claire: left midfielder\n   - Dave: left winger\n   - Eve: goalkeeper\n\n3. Bob and Dave trade positions:\n   - Alice: fullback\n   - Bob: left winger\n   - Claire: left midfielder\n   - Dave: center midfielder\n   - Eve: goalkeeper\n\n4. Eve and Claire trade positions:\n   - Alice: fullback\n   - Bob: left winger\n   - Claire: goalkeeper\n   - Dave: center midfielder\n   - Eve: left midfielder\n\n5. Dave and Claire trade positions:\n   - Alice: fullback\n   - Bob: left winger\n   - Claire: center midfielder\n   - Dave: goalkeeper\n   - Eve: left midfielder\n\nAt the end of the match, Bob is playing as the left winger."

Dave and Alice trade positions:\n   - Alice was playing cheerleader, and Dave was playing left midfielder.\n   - After the swap, Alice is now playing left midfielder, and Dave is now the cheerleader.\n\n2. Alice and Bob trade positions:\n   - Alice is now playing left midfielder, and Bob was playing fullback.\n   - After the swap, Alice remains in the left midfielder position, and Bob is now the cheerleader.\n\n3. Dave and Eve trade positions:\n   - Dave is currently the cheerleader, and Eve was playing goalkeeper.\n   - After the swap, Dave becomes the goalkeeper, and Eve is now the cheerleader.\n\n4. Bob and Dave trade positions:\n   - Bob is currently the cheerleader, and Dave is the goalkeeper.\n   - After the swap, Bob becomes the goalkeeper, and Dave is now the cheerleader.\n\n5. Alice and Claire trade positions:\n   - Alice is currently the left midfielder, and Claire was playing center midfielder.\n   - After the swap, Alice becomes the center midfielder, and Claire is now the left midfielder.\n\nSo, at the end of the match, Dave is playing the cheerleader position."

This information suggests that the safety level of 18650 batteries is improving, which weakens the expert's judgment that the probability of fire for a battery pack consisting of 7,000 small batteries is 0.14%. If the safety level is improving, the probability of fire may be lower than the expert's estimate.\n\n(C) This option states that TESLA has a very advanced battery management system, which will automatically disconnect the output of abnormal battery cells.

Therefore, it does not significantly weaken the expert's judgment.\n\n(B) This option states that billions of 18650 batteries are produced every year in the world, and their safety level is constantly improving. This information suggests that the safety level of 18650 batteries is improving, which weakens the expert's judgment that the probability of fire for a battery pack consisting of 7,000 small batteries is 0.14%. If the safety level is improving, the probability of fire may be lower than the expert's estimate.\n\n(C) This option states that TESLA has a very advanced battery management system, which will automatically disconnect the output of abnormal battery cells. This information suggests that TESLA has measures in place to prevent or mitigate battery fires. This weakens the expert's judgment by indicating that TESLA's battery management system reduces the probability of fire.\n\n(D) This option states that the 18650 battery can be recharged many times, so the service life of the battery is greatly extended. While this information is useful, it does not directly address the probability of fire or the frequency of battery fire accidents. Therefore, it does not significantly weaken the expert's judgment.\n\nBased on the evaluation, option (C) most powerfully weakens the expert's judgment by suggesting that TESLA's advanced battery management system reduces the probability of fire."

However, the statement does not mention that insanity can only be caused by using tin ware. It is possible for someone to become insane due to other reasons unrelated to tin ware. Therefore, statement (A) cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\nNext, let's consider statement (B): \"Regardless of his other aspects, Emperor Nero must be insane.\"\n\nThe given information states that every Roman emperor drinks wine and uses tin ware. It also states that using tin ware to drink alcohol, even once, can cause poisoning and subsequently lead to insanity. Since Emperor Nero is a Roman emperor, it can be inferred that he drinks wine and uses tin ware. However, the information does not explicitly state that Emperor Nero has been poisoned or has become insane. Therefore, statement (B) cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\nMoving on to statement (C): \"The use of tin ware was a privilege of the Roman emperor.\"\n\nThe given information does not mention anything about the use of tin ware being exclusive to the Roman emperor.

The passage states that ordinary people believe that humans may usher in the era of \"customized babies\". So, we need to find an option that refutes this belief.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option to see if it refutes the belief:\n\n(A) \"Artificial\" genetic screening does not rule out that there will be loopholes; in natural conception, the guidelines for survival of the fittest in nature seem to be more subtle and effective.\n\nThis option does not directly refute the belief in \"customized babies\". It only suggests that natural conception may have its own advantages. It does not address the possibility of customized babies.\n\n(B) It can be seen from the development history of modern science and technology that technological development is often faster than human cognition, and sometimes technology will go further and deviate from the track of human cognition.\n\nThis option also does not directly refute the belief in \"customized babies\". It only suggests that technology can sometimes deviate from human cognition. It does not address the possibility of customized babies.\n\n(C) Gene screening is mainly to avoid reproductive defects, this technology brings opportunities for human eugenics and eugenics; as for \"customized babies\", the concept of cloning is more involved, the two should not be confused.\n\nThis option does not directly refute the belief in \"customized babies\". It only suggests that gene screening is mainly for avoiding reproductive defects and that the concept of cloning should not be confused with customized babies. It does not address the possibility of customized babies.\n\n(D) \"Customized babies\" have not been tried globally, this concept also challenges the most controversial human reproductive ethics.\n\nThis option directly refutes the belief in \"customized babies\". It states that customized babies have not been tried globally and that the concept challenges the most controversial human reproductive ethics.\n\nTherefore, option (D) is the best choice to refute the views of ordinary people."

In the first half of 2004, the price increase in China exceeded the interest rate of bank deposits. This means that the rate of inflation was higher than the interest rate offered by banks on savings deposits.\n\nNext, we are told that residents' income continued to increase, but the growth rate of residents' savings deposits declined. This suggests that people were earning more money, but they were not saving as much as before.\n\nIn July, there was an outflow of deposits amounting to about 100 billion yuan, and the proportion of time deposits (long-term deposits) in all deposits continued to decline.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) As the expected price continues to rise, many residents' funds can only survive, so that they can buy the goods they need at any time.\nThis option suggests that people are spending their savings to buy goods due to the expected rise in prices. However, this does not explain the outflow of deposits or the decline in the proportion of time deposits.\n\n(B) Due to the expected increase in bank interest rates, many residents' funds can only survive for a period of time.\nThis option suggests that people are withdrawing their savings because they expect bank interest rates to increase. However, there is no mention of expected interest rate increases in the passage.\n\n(C) As the state controls the scale of loans, the funds of the majority of private enterprises are tight, and private lending is active. The interest on lending has been much higher than the bank deposit interest rate.\nThis option suggests that private enterprises are facing tight funds and are actively engaging in private lending. The higher interest rates on lending compared to bank deposit rates could incentivize residents to withdraw their savings and invest in private lending. This option aligns with the information provided in the passage and explains the outflow of deposits.\n\n(D) Because bank deposit interest rates are too low, many residents consider whether to buy stocks or funds.\nThis option suggests that residents are considering investing in stocks or funds instead of keeping their money in bank deposits due to low interest rates. While this may be a factor, it does not explain the outflow of deposits or the decline in the proportion of time deposits.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, option (C) - As the state controls the scale of loans, the funds of the majority of private enterprises are tight, and private lending is active. The interest on lending has been much higher than the bank deposit interest rate - can best explain the flow of"

If Sichuan restaurants are more popular, it implies that more people are choosing to dine at these restaurants instead of feasting at home.\n\n(D) The new restaurant will only open if the existing restaurant cannot fit in.\nThis statement is unrelated to the conclusion and does not provide any information about people's dining preferences or the increase in Sichuan restaurants.\n\nBased on the analysis, statement (C) is the only one that directly supports the conclusion. Therefore, in order for the conclusion to be true, statement (C) must be true."

It simply explains the reason for the ranking of the Qiankun hexagrams. Therefore, statement (A) does not shake the traditional view.\n\nNow, let's consider statement (B): \"The hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory alone, nor can it be explained by the sense of meaning alone. Only by combining the two can we give an explanation of all hexagram names.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that both the orientation theory and the sense of meaning are necessary to explain the names of all hexagrams. It challenges the traditional view that the names of the hexagrams have no meaning. Therefore, statement (B) does shake the traditional view.\n\nMoving on to statement (C): \"Although there are many different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, it is inseparable from its sect, either attributed to the theory of fetching images, or attributed to the theory of fetching meanings.\"\n\nThis statement acknowledges that there are different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, but it does not directly challenge the traditional view. It simply suggests that the origin can be attributed to either the theory of fetching images or the theory of fetching meanings. Therefore, statement (C) does not shake the traditional view.\n\nLastly, let's consider statement (D): \"The name of the hexagram comes from the account of the narration of the hexagram. Kun Guazhan asked about the loss of the horse. At the beginning, he had three elephants. He believed that the horse could be found and was named Kun.\"\n\nThis statement provides a specific account of how the hexagram Kun got its name. It challenges the traditional view that the names of the hexagrams have no meaning and suggests that they are derived from specific narratives. Therefore, statement (D) does shake the traditional view.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that most seriously shakes the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name is (D): \"The name of the hexagram comes from the account of the narration of the hexagram. Kun Guazhan asked about the loss of the horse. At the beginning, he had three elephants. He believed that the horse could be found and was named Kun.\""

This means that H and I cannot be the assistant general manager in charge of the same department.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"F and M are not in charge of the same department.\" This means that F and M cannot be the assistant general manager in charge of the same department.\n\nBased on these conditions, we can conclude that F, G, H, I, M, and P are each in charge of one department, except for one of them who is in charge of three departments.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) F and H are in charge of the same department - This is possible, as F and H can each be in charge of one department, and one of them can also be in charge of three departments.\n\n(B) F and I are in charge of the same department - This is possible, as F and I can each be in charge of one department, and one of them can also be in charge of three departments.\n\n(C) I and P are in charge of the same department - This is possible, as I and P can each be in charge of one department, and one of them can also be in charge of three departments.\n\n(D) M and G are in charge of the same department - This is not possible, as M and G cannot be the assistant general manager in charge of the same department.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) M and G are in charge of the same department."

This statement suggests that Mrs. Wang was at fault for crossing the road guardrail in violation of regulations and that she should have expected a car on the motorway. It also implies that being frightened by a car is a common reaction. However, this statement does not directly address the deficiencies in the first instance of the case. It focuses more on assigning blame to Mrs. Wang rather than evaluating the court's decision-making process.\n\nNext, let's consider statement (B). This statement argues that the verdict violated traditional morals and could discourage people from helping the injured, similar to the Nanjing Peng Yu case. While this statement raises a valid concern about the potential impact of the verdict on public behavior, it does not specifically address the deficiencies in the first instance of the case.\n\nMoving on to statement (C). This statement points out that the verdict did not clarify the facts and that the evidence was seriously insufficient. It suggests that it is possible that Mrs. Wang fell first and Xu Cai drove over her. This statement directly addresses the deficiencies in the first instance of the case by highlighting the lack of clarity in the facts and the insufficiency of evidence. It questions whether the court thoroughly examined all the available evidence before reaching a conclusion.\n\nLastly, let's consider statement (D). This statement claims that the judgment reversed the cause and the result. However, without further explanation or context, it is unclear how this statement specifically points out the deficiencies in the first instance of the case.\n\nBased on the analysis above, statement (C) appears to be the most accurate and relevant in pointing out the deficiencies in the first instance of the case.",

Therefore, we can eliminate option (B) G.\n\nNow we are left with options (C) J and (D) N.\n\nSince N is the last speaker, N cannot be the speaker immediately after M. Therefore, the speaker immediately after M must be J.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) J."

This means that the human resources department and the sales department cannot be on consecutive floors.\n\nBased on these three pieces of information, we can start to eliminate some options:\n\nOption (A) is not possible because it has the finance department and the planning department adjacent to each other, which contradicts statement (2).\n\nOption (B) is not possible because it has the human resources department and the sales department adjacent to each other, which contradicts statement (1).\n\nOption (C) is a possible arrangement that satisfies all the given conditions. It has the planning department on the bottom floor, followed by the finance department, sales department, research and development department, administration department, and human resources department.\n\nOption (D) is not possible because it has the sales department on the bottom floor, which contradicts statement (3).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C): Planning Department, Finance Department, Sales Department, R & D Department, Administration Department, Human Resources Department.",

(1) If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in the front.Bit.(2) If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.(3) If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.(4) Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.(5) P cannot be in the same team as Q.(6) If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.\n\nIf H is in Team 2, which of the listed arrangements is acceptable for Team 1?\n\n(A)Before? L Middle? Q After? N\n(B)Before? G In? K After? N\n(C)Before? L Middle? Q After? G\n(D)Before? G Middle? K After?

It asks about the amount of vitamin B6 in people's diets, but it does not address the specific issue of whether the elderly are likely to get enough vitamin B6.\n\n(B) Is vitamin B6 in fortified food more easily absorbed by the body than vitamin B6 in the daily diet?\nThis question is also not directly relevant to the argument. It asks about the absorption of vitamin B6, but it does not address the specific issue of whether the elderly are likely to get enough vitamin B6.\n\n(C) Does the amount of calories needed to decrease each day be greater than the amount of vitamin B6 that needs to be increased each day?\nThis question is directly relevant to the argument. It addresses the issue of whether the decrease in calorie demand is greater than the increase in vitamin B6 demand. If the decrease in calorie demand is greater, then the argument's claim that the elderly are unlikely to get enough vitamin B6 would be weakened.\n\n(D) Are the consequences of not getting enough vitamin B6 daily for the elderly more serious than for the young?\nThis question is not directly relevant to the argument. It asks about the consequences of not getting enough vitamin B6, but it does not address the specific issue of whether the elderly are likely to get enough vitamin B6.\n\nBased on our evaluation, the answer choice that is most helpful in evaluating the appeal argument is (C) Does the amount of calories needed to decrease each day be greater than the amount of vitamin B6 that needs to be increased each day?",

Let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Cars drive faster on long streets than on short streets, so pedestrians on long streets are more dangerous than pedestrians on short streets.\nThis argument is flawed because it assumes that the speed of cars is the sole determinant of pedestrian danger. It ignores other factors such as traffic volume, pedestrian infrastructure, and driver behavior.\n\n(B) Many people who later become entrepreneurs often participate in competitive sports when they are in college. Therefore, participation in competitive sports must promote the ability to make people entrepreneurs.\nThis argument is flawed because it assumes a causal relationship between participation in competitive sports and becoming an entrepreneur without considering other factors that may contribute to entrepreneurial success, such as education, experience, and personal characteristics.\n\n(C) The petals of mulberry chrysanthemum will be closed at noon, so the petals of mulberry chrysanthemum will definitely open at night.\nThis argument is flawed because it assumes that the behavior of mulberry chrysanthemum petals at noon is indicative of their behavior at night. It ignores the possibility of other factors, such as temperature or light conditions, influencing the opening of the petals.\n\n(D) The events in Eastern Europe will affect the political situation in Central America, so the liberalization of Eastern Europe will lead to the liberalization of Central America.\nThis argument is flawed because it assumes a direct causal relationship between events in Eastern Europe and the political situation in Central America without considering other factors that may influence political developments in Central America, such as domestic politics or regional dynamics.\n\nBased on the analysis, the argument in option (D) contains defects most similar to those in the original argument.

They are saying that strengthening rodent control to reduce the number of rats will do more harm than good. This means that reducing the rat population may have negative consequences.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option to see which one confirms the expert's warning:\n\n(A) Rats infected with Leishmaniasis have few chances of directly transmitting the disease to people.\nThis option does not confirm the warning because it does not provide any information about the potential harm of reducing the rat population.\n\n(B) Leishmaniasis is more contagious in rats than in humans.\nThis option also does not confirm the warning because it only provides information about the contagiousness of the disease, but not about the potential harm of reducing the rat population.\n\n(C) Sand flies that do not infect leishmaniasis are not harmful to human health.\nThis option does not confirm the warning because it only provides information about sand flies that do not carry leishmaniasis, but not about the potential harm of reducing the rat population.\n\n(D) Sand flies bite people only when the number of mice is insufficient.\nThis option confirms the warning because it suggests that reducing the number of mice (by strengthening rodent control) may lead to an insufficient number of mice, which in turn may result in sand flies biting people. This implies that reducing the rat population may have negative consequences.\n\nTherefore, the best option that confirms the expert's warning is (D) Sand flies bite people only when the number of mice is insufficient."

If they do not want to import inflation, each country has to let its currency appreciate.\n5. If the local currency appreciates, it will inhibit domestic exports and cause economic decline.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n(A) If the Fed launches QE3, if other countries want to avoid their own economic decline, they should not buy US dollar assets.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. While it is true that buying US dollar assets can lead to inflationary pressures and currency appreciation, it does not mean that not buying US dollar assets will automatically avoid economic decline. There could be other factors at play that can impact a country's economic decline.\n\n(B) Other countries are either facing the pressure of imported inflation or facing the risk of economic decline.\n\nThis statement is likely to be true. If countries buy dollar assets to maintain exchange rate stability, they will face the pressure of imported inflation. On the other hand, if they do not buy dollar assets and let their currency appreciate, it can inhibit domestic exports and cause economic decline.\n\n(C) If there is no imported inflation in other countries and there is no appreciation of the local currency, the Fed has not launched QE3.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true.

If depression is an organic disease, it could support the idea that an imbalance of neurotransmitters is causing the condition. Therefore, this statement could provide some support for the medical scientist's conclusion.\n\n(B) It may be that depression leads to an imbalance in the concentration of these three neurotransmitters in the brain.\nThis statement suggests a possible causal relationship between depression and the imbalance of neurotransmitters. If depression leads to an imbalance, it would support the idea that the imbalance is causing the condition. Therefore, this statement could also provide support for the medical scientist's conclusion.\n\n(C) Women and the elderly are high-risk groups of depression.\nThis statement provides information about high-risk groups for depression, but it does not directly support or refute the medical scientist's conclusion about neurotransmitter imbalance causing depression. Therefore, this statement does not provide strong support for the conclusion.\n\n(D) Drugs developed for the above three neurotransmitters to maintain their concentration balance are effective in treating depression.\nThis statement suggests that drugs targeting the three neurotransmitters are effective in treating depression. If these drugs are effective, it would support the idea that the imbalance of neurotransmitters is causing the condition. Therefore, this statement could provide strong support for the medical scientist's conclusion.\n\nBased on the evaluation of each statement, the statement that provides the strongest support for the medical scientist's conclusion is (D) - Drugs developed for the above three neurotransmitters to maintain their concentration balance are effective in treating depression."

Y reached the end before T and W, two athletes who reached before Y were wearing red costumes, S is the sixth athlete to finish, and Z reached before U.\n\n(C) Z, W, U, T, Y, S, X\n- This option does not satisfy the information that Y reached the end before T and W.\n\n(D) Z, U, T, Y, W, S, X\n- This option does not satisfy the information that two athletes who reached before Y were wearing red costumes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) X, Y, Z, U, W, S, T."

However, it does not consider other possible factors that could have contributed to the decrease in egg production.\n\n(B) The statement assumes that because the bacteria that cause tetanus survive in the digestive tract of horses and tetanus is highly contagious, horses must be more susceptible to tetanus than most other animals. This is a hasty generalization as it does not consider other factors that could contribute to the susceptibility of horses to tetanus.\n\n(C) The statement assumes that because malnourished animals are easily infected with diseases and animals in big city zoos are not malnourished, they are definitely not easily infected. This is a fallacy of denying the antecedent as it assumes that the absence of malnutrition guarantees the absence of susceptibility to diseases.\n\n(D) The statement assumes that because the ape is characterized by a reversed thumb and no tail, and a fossil remnant of an unknown animal with a reversible thumb has been discovered, it must be an ape. This is a fallacy of affirming the consequent as it assumes that the presence of a reversible thumb guarantees that the animal is an ape.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that contains reasoning errors most similar to the given statement is (A) \"A low-calcium diet can lead to decreased egg production in poultry. After the chickens on a farm were released for food in spring, their egg production decreased significantly. Therefore, the calcium content of the food they find and ingest must be very low.\""

It then concludes that these two views are inconsistent in their perspective on the cost of soldiers.\n\nTo weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that challenges the assumption that the two views are inconsistent in their perspective on the cost of soldiers.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n(A) During World War II, the German army achieved a series of victories by blitzkrieg, and was dragged into a protracted battle after entering the Soviet Union. As a result, Hitler repeated Napoleon's mistakes.\n\nThis statement provides an example of a military strategy that initially succeeded with quick, decisive battles but later faced challenges in a protracted battle. However, it does not directly address the inconsistency between Sun Tzu's and Mao Zedong's views on the cost of soldiers. Therefore, it does not weaken the argument effectively.\n\n(B) The invaders of the Japanese invaders must have a quick decision. Mao Zedong's protracted war is a countermeasure against the enemy's quick decisive battle. He is talking about long-lasting strategy, not long-lasting tactics.\n\nThis statement suggests that Mao Zedong's concept of protracted warfare is not contradictory to the need for quick decision-making in battles. It highlights that Mao Zedong's focus is on long-lasting strategy rather than long-lasting tactics. This challenges the assumption made in the initial argument and weakens it effectively.\n\n(C) The current war on terrorism in the world is a partial or short-term battle, and an overall or long-term battle.\n\nThis statement discusses the nature of the current war on terrorism, but it does not directly address the inconsistency between Sun Tzu's and Mao Zedong's views on the cost of soldiers. Therefore, it does not weaken the argument effectively.\n\n(D) Mao Zedong's military writings and \"Sun Zi's Art of War\" have a high degree of consistency in the viewpoints of \"knowing each other and knowing oneself, fighting a hundred battles\" and \"preparing one's opponents and being surprised.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that there is a high degree of consistency between Mao Zedong's military writings and Sun Tzu's \"Art of War\" in terms of understanding one's own strengths and weaknesses and being prepared for the enemy. However, it does not directly address the inconsistency between their views on the cost of soldiers"

This would explain why both robots made errors in picking up the correct objects.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A."

It does not directly address the importance of financing channels, so it does not weaken the initial statement as effectively.\n\n(D) When deciding whether to fund startups, venture capitalists must consider the personal qualities of the entrepreneur, the company's strategic planning, and other factors.\nThis statement suggests that venture capitalists consider factors other than financing channels when deciding to fund startups. It weakens the initial statement by indicating that personal qualities of entrepreneurs and company strategic planning are also important factors for success.\n\nBased on the analysis, statement (A) weakens the initial statement most effectively by suggesting a high failure rate among new companies, indicating that factors other than financing channels are important for success."

It focuses on the consequences of misplacement and misjudgment, but it does not address the issue of positive misjudgments or the prioritization of not letting a bad person go free.\n\nBased on the analysis above, none of the options strongly support the views of the jurists. However, option (A) is the closest as it indirectly addresses the issue of accuracy in handling cases, which is a relevant factor in minimizing positive misjudgments."

While it is stated that excellent writers are sensitive and imaginative, it does not necessarily mean that only excellent writers can write touching works. There could be other sensitive and imaginative writers who are not classified as excellent.\n\n(B) Some sensitive and imaginative writers are not excellent writers.\nThis statement can be concluded from the given information. It is stated that excellent writers are sensitive and imaginative, but it does not specify that all sensitive and imaginative writers are excellent. Therefore, it is possible for some sensitive and imaginative writers to not be excellent writers.\n\n(C) Writers who can write touching works are excellent writers.\nThis statement cannot be concluded from the given information. While it is stated that only sensitive and imaginative people can write touching works, it does not necessarily mean that all writers who can write touching works are excellent writers.

It provides information about the diet of the predators but does not establish a direct link to the vervet monkey's behavior.\n\nNext, let's consider statement (B): \"Vervet monkeys climb onto trees to avoid terrestrial carnivores, and underneath potential leaves to avoid raptors.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that vervet monkeys have specific strategies to avoid terrestrial carnivores and raptors. They climb onto trees to escape terrestrial predators and seek shelter under leaves to avoid raptors. This information is relevant to understanding the behavior of the vervet monkey and provides a possible explanation for why they scream differently depending on the source of danger. It suggests that the different screams may serve as a warning to their companions about the type of predator approaching.\n\nMoving on to statement (C): \"No predator that poses a danger to vervet monkeys can attack vervet monkeys from both land and air.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that there are no predators that can attack vervet monkeys from both land and air. If this statement is true, it would explain why vervet monkeys have developed different screams for terrestrial and aerial predators. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of this statement.\n\nLastly, let's consider statement (D): \"Different types of carnivores can deal with different numbers of vervet monkeys.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that different types of carnivores have varying abilities to capture vervet monkeys. While this information may be interesting, it does not directly explain why vervet monkeys scream differently depending on the source of danger.\n\nBased on the analysis, statement (B) is the most helpful in explaining the behavior of the vervet monkey. It provides a plausible explanation for why they scream differently depending on the type of predator approaching."

However, only by liberalizing the upper limit of deposit interest rates can we truly realize the marketization of interest rates.

Once the upper limit of deposit interest rates is lifted, interest rate wars will begin between banks, leading to increased financial risks.

The liberalization of the upper limit of deposit interest rates is necessary for the marketization of interest rates.\n2. If the government does not give up its power, market forces will not be able to play a role.\n3. Once the upper limit of deposit interest rates is lifted, interest rate wars between banks may occur, leading to increased financial risks.\n4.

If he acquires these weapons, he will become more dangerous. He is the threat that the United States should resolve after the 9.11 incident. For 12 years, the world has been saying that he is very dangerous, and we have only solved this danger until now.

Group A did their own things for ten minutes but did not engage in things that would lead to lying; Group B was asked to steal test papers and lied during the test.After that, the researchers asked the subjects to put on special electrodes to record the blink frequency of the interrogation.It was found that the blinking frequency of group A increased slightly, but the blinking frequency of group B decreased first, and then increased significantly to 8 times the normal frequency.It can be seen from this? by observing a person's blink frequency, it can be judged whether he is lying.\n\nThe answer to which of the following questions would hardly question the conclusion of this study?\n\n(A)Are there significant differences in the psychological qualities of the subjects in groups A and B?\n(B)The subjects in group B were told to tell lies, rather than telling lies themselves.Is the correlation between telling lies and blinking reliable?\n(C)Are there any abnormalities in the equipment used in groups A and B?\n(D)Will telling lies cause a rapid heartbeat and increased blood pressure?\n\nSolution: First, let's review the conclusion of the study: \"By observing a person's blink frequency, it can be judged whether he is lying.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze each question and see if it would question the conclusion:\n\n(A) \"Are there significant differences in the psychological qualities of the subjects in groups A and B?\" - This question is relevant because it explores whether the psychological qualities of the subjects could have influenced the results. If there are significant differences, it could suggest that the blinking frequency is not solely indicative of lying. Therefore, this question could potentially question the conclusion.\n\n(B) \"The subjects in group B were told to tell lies, rather than telling lies themselves. Is the correlation between telling lies and blinking reliable?\" - This question is also relevant because it questions the reliability of the correlation between telling lies and blinking. If the subjects were instructed to lie, it raises the possibility that their blinking frequency may have been influenced by the act of lying rather than the act of stealing. Therefore, this question could also question the conclusion.\n\n(C) \"Are there any abnormalities in the equipment used in groups A and B?\" - This question is important to ensure the validity of the study. If there were abnormalities in the equipment, it could have affected the accuracy of the blink frequency measurements. However, it does not directly question the conclusion about judging lying based on blink frequency.\n\n(D) \"Will telling lies cause a rapid heartbeat and increased blood pressure?\" - This question is not directly related to the conclusion of the study, which is about judging lying based on blink frequency. It explores the physiological effects of telling lies, but it does not question the validity of using blink frequency as an indicator of lying.\n\nBased on this analysis, the question that would hardly question the conclusion of the study is (D) \"Will telling lies cause a rapid heartbeat and increased blood pressure?\""

(1) Li was hired by Tianshu; (2) Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit; (3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit; (4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang Ye Was hired by Tianxuan.\n\nWhich of the following is correct, you can determine the employer of each graduate?\n\n(A)Li was hired by Tianshu.\n(B)Zhang was hired by Tianxuan.\n(C)Zhang was hired by Tianshu.\n(D)Liu was hired by Tianji.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the information given:\n\n(1) Li was hired by Tianshu.\n(2) Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit.\n(3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit.\n(4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang Ye was hired by Tianxuan.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nFrom (1), we know that Li was hired by Tianshu.\n\nFrom (2), we know that Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit. Since Li was hired by Tianshu, Zhao cannot be hired by Tianshu.\n\nFrom (3), we know that Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit. Since Zhao cannot be hired by Tianshu, Liu must be hired by Tianshu.\n\nFrom (4), we know that if Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang Ye was hired by Tianxuan. However, we don't have any information about Zhang's employer yet.\n\nBased on the information we have so far, we can conclude the following:\n\nLi was hired by Tianshu.\nLiu was hired by Tianshu.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining options:\n\n(A) Li was hired by Tianshu. This is correct based on the information given.\n\n(B) Zhang was hired by Tianxuan. We don't have enough information to determine Zhang's employer yet.\n\n(C) Zhang was hired by Tianshu. We don't have enough information to determine Zhang's employer yet.\n\n(D) Liu was hired by Tianji. This is incorrect based on the information given.

It then presents a study that shows a correlation between campaign funding and judicial decisions. Specifically, it states that in cases where the party involved was its own campaign sponsor, 65% of the judges of the Supreme Court of Louisiana supported the campaign sponsor.\n\nNow let's evaluate the statements:\n\n(A) The argument improperly presupposes that in a case where the party involved is a campaign sponsor, the proportion of judgments supporting the sponsor should not exceed 50%.\n\nThis statement points out a potential problem with the argument. The argument assumes that if a party involved in a case is a campaign sponsor, the proportion of judgments in favor of the sponsor should not exceed 50%. However, it does not provide any justification for this assumption. Therefore, this statement correctly identifies a problem with the argument.\n\n(B) The argument failed to explain the impact of the amount of campaign funding on the judgment.\n\nThis statement also highlights a problem with the argument. The argument does not provide any information about the impact of the amount of campaign funding on the judgment. It only states that there is a correlation between campaign funding and judicial decisions, but it does not explain how the amount of funding influences the judgment. Therefore, this statement correctly identifies a problem with the argument.\n\n(C) The argument ignores the fact that under the circumstances that campaign funding and judicial decisions are completely transparent, the media's supervision of justice is everywhere.\n\nThis statement introduces a new factor - the transparency of campaign funding and judicial decisions, as well as the media's supervision of justice. While this may be a relevant consideration, the argument does not address these factors. Therefore, this statement does not directly point out a problem with the argument.\n\n(D) The argument does not give the proportion of campaign sponsors among all involved parties.\n\nThis statement highlights a missing piece of information in the argument. The argument does not provide the proportion of campaign sponsors among all involved parties. Without this information, it is difficult to determine the significance of the 65% figure mentioned in the argument. Therefore, this statement correctly identifies a problem with the argument.\n\nBased on the analysis, statements (A), (B), and (D) all point out problems in the argument. However, statement (C) does not directly address the issues raised in the argument. Therefore, the best statement that points out the problems in the argument is either (A), (B), or ("

Therefore, this option is not possible.\n\n(C) L or N: Since G must speak before lunch and G cannot be the third speaker, L must be the third speaker. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\n(D) M or N: Since M cannot be the third speaker, this option is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) L or N."

The argument assumes that the reappearance of bicycles in 1860 indicates that they were reaccepted, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.\n\n(D) Without giving a reasonable explanation, it is deemed to be truly accepted: This answer choice does not accurately describe the flaw in the reasoning. The argument does not assume that bicycles were truly accepted without giving a reasonable explanation.\n\nBased on the evaluation of each answer choice, the correct answer is (C) - the argument has a misconception that the reappearance of bicycles in 1860 indicates that they were reaccepted, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption."

The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.\n\nIf the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)Farley gives the watercolors lecture.\n(B)Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.\n(C)Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.\n(D)Holden gives the sculptures lecture.\n(E)Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which of the given statements could be true based on the given constraints and the information that the watercolors lecture is third.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the given constraints:\n\n1. The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.\n2. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.\n3. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement and see if it could be true based on the given constraints and the information that the watercolors lecture is third:\n\n(A) Farley gives the watercolors lecture.\nAccording to constraint 2, Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Since the watercolors lecture is third, it means that the oil paintings lecture must be later than the watercolors lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture. This statement is not true.\n\n(B) Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.\nAccording to constraint 1, the oil paintings lecture must be later than the watercolors lecture. Since the watercolors lecture is third, it means that the oil paintings lecture must be fourth. Therefore, Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture. This statement is not true.\n\n(C) Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.\nThere are no constraints that directly relate to Garcia giving the sculptures lecture. Since the watercolors lecture is third, it means that the sculptures lecture must be either first, second, or fourth. Therefore, this statement could be true.\n\n(D) Holden gives the sculptures lecture.\nAccording to constraint 3, Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Since the watercolors lecture is third, it means that Holden's lecture must be either first or second. Therefore, Holden cannot give the sculptures lecture. This statement is not true.\n\n(E) Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.\nAccording to constraint 1, the lithographs lecture must be later than the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture. Since the watercolors lecture is third, it means that the lithographs lecture must be fourth. Therefore, Jiang cannot give the lithographs lecture. This statement is not true.\n\nBased on our analysis, the only statement that could be true is (C) Garcia gives the sculptures lecture."

Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.\n\nYoshida's audition could be\n\n(A)fifth\n(B)fourth\n(C)third\n(D)second\n(E)first\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine the position of Yoshida's audition among the six auditions, given the given conditions and restrictions.\n\nSolution: First, let's analyze the given conditions and restrictions:\n\n1. The fourth audition cannot be recorded.\n2. The fifth audition must be recorded.\n3. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.\n4. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.\n5. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.\n\nNow, let's consider each condition and see how it affects the position of Yoshida's audition:\n\n1. The fourth audition cannot be recorded.\n   This means that the fourth audition cannot be Yoshida's audition.\n\n2. The fifth audition must be recorded.\n   This means that the fifth audition must be Yoshida's audition.\n\n3. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.\n   Since Yoshida's audition is the fifth and must be recorded, Waite's audition must be earlier than Yoshida's. Therefore, Waite's audition cannot be the fifth.\n\n4. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.\n   This condition does not directly affect the position of Yoshida's audition.\n\n5. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.\n   Since Yoshida's audition is the fifth, Zinn's audition must be earlier than the fifth. Therefore, Zinn's audition cannot be the fifth.\n\nBased on these conditions, we can conclude that Yoshida's audition must be the fifth. Therefore, the answer is (A) fifth."

Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings\n\nWhich one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?\n\n(A)RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building\n(B)RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House\n(C)RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building\n(D)RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House\n(E)RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which one of the given options could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made.\n\nSolution: First, let's analyze the given options one by one and see if they satisfy the conditions of the problem.\n\n(A) RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower\n    Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House\n    Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building\n\nIn this option, RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1). This satisfies the condition of trading one building for another building of the same class. However, the other two companies, Southco and Trustcorp, do not make any trades. Therefore, option (A) does not satisfy the conditions of the problem.\n\n(B) RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building\n    Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building\n    Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House\n\nIn this option, RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the King Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2). This satisfies the condition of trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings. Southco and Trustcorp do not make any trades. Therefore, option (B) satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n\n(C) RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building\n    Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House\n    Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building\n\nIn this option, RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Lynch Building (class 2) and the Flores Tower (class 1). This does not satisfy any of the trading conditions mentioned in the problem. Therefore, option (C) does not satisfy the conditions of the problem.\n\n(D) RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House\n    Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building\n    Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House\n\nIn this option, RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Meyer Building (class 2) and the Yates House (class 3). This satisfies the condition of trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings. Southco and Trustcorp do not make any trades. Therefore, option (D) satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n\n(E) RealProp: the Garza"

Therefore, we can conclude that either G or H must be the fifth scientist selected.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining chemists:\n\n- Chemists: K and M\n\nFrom the given information, we know that K and M cannot both be selected. Since we have not selected K yet, we can conclude that K must be the fifth scientist selected.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) K."

If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\n\nBased on these constraints, we can start by considering the first constraint. Since either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, can be assigned to an ambassadorship, we have two possibilities:\n\n1. Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship and Novetzke is not.\n2.

Therefore, if Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.\n\nFinally, let's consider the fourth constraint.

If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information and determine the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen.\nIn this scenario, we know that Kayne cannot be assigned to Venezuela or Zambia. Therefore, the only possibility is that Kayne is assigned to Yemen.\n\nBased on this scenario, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n(A) Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. Jaramillo could be assigned to Venezuela, but it is not a requirement.\n\n(B) Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. Landon could be assigned to Zambia, but it is not a requirement.\n\n(C) Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. Ong could be assigned to Zambia, but it is not a requirement.\n\n(D) Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. Jaramillo could be assigned to an ambassadorship, but it is not a requirement.\n\n(E) Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. Ong could be assigned to an ambassadorship, but it is not a requirement.\n\nTherefore, none of the statements must be true if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen."

No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.\n\nIf Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?\n\n(A)Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.\n(B)Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.\n(C)Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.\n(D)Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.\n(E)Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which statement must be true based on the given conditions.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the given conditions:\n\n1. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.\n2. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.\n3. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.\n4. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.\n5. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conditions and see if we can determine which statement must be true.\n\nCondition 1 tells us that each wall must have at least one oil painting displayed on it.\n\nCondition 2 tells us that each wall must have the work of at least two students displayed on it.\n\nCondition 3 tells us that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.\n\nCondition 4 tells us that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. This means that Franz's oil must be displayed on a wall with an upper position.\n\nCondition 5 tells us that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. This means that wall 4 must have an upper position available for another painting.\n\nBased on these conditions, we can determine that statement (A) must be true: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.\n\nThis is because we know that Franz's oil must be displayed on a wall with an upper position, and since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the same wall, it must be Greene's oil that is displayed in the upper position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position."

Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\n\nWhich one of the following is a possible assignment of riders to bicycles, with the riders for each bicycle listed in the order in which they test the bicycle?\n\n(A)F: Seamus, Reynaldo; G: Yuki, Seamus; H: Theresa, Yuki; J: Reynaldo, Theresa\n(B)F: Seamus, Yuki; G: Reynaldo, Theresa; H: Yuki, Seamus; J: Theresa, Reynaldo\n(C)F: Yuki, Seamus; G: Seamus, Reynaldo; H: Theresa, Yuki; J: Reynaldo, Theresa\n(D)F: Yuki, Seamus; G: Theresa, Reynaldo; H: Reynaldo, Theresa; J: Seamus, Yuki\n(E)F: Yuki, Theresa; G: Seamus, Yuki; H: Theresa, Reynaldo; J: Reynaldo, Seamus\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine a possible assignment of riders to bicycles, following the given conditions.\n\nSolution: First, let's analyze the given conditions:\n\n1. Reynaldo cannot test F.\n2. Yuki cannot test J.\n3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.\n4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\n\nNow, let's go through each option and see if it satisfies all the conditions:\n\n(A) F: Seamus, Reynaldo; G: Yuki, Seamus; H: Theresa, Yuki; J: Reynaldo, Theresa\n- This option violates condition 1 because Reynaldo tests F.\n\n(B) F: Seamus, Yuki; G: Reynaldo, Theresa; H: Yuki, Seamus; J: Theresa, Reynaldo\n- This option violates condition 3 because Theresa does not test H.\n\n(C) F: Yuki, Seamus; G: Seamus, Reynaldo; H: Theresa, Yuki; J: Reynaldo, Theresa\n- This option violates condition 4 because Seamus does not test the bicycle Yuki tested on the first day.\n\n(D) F: Yuki, Seamus; G: Theresa, Reynaldo; H: Reynaldo, Theresa; J: Seamus, Yuki\n- This option satisfies all the conditions.\n\n(E) F: Yuki, Theresa; G: Seamus, Yuki; H: Theresa, Reynaldo; J: Reynaldo, Seamus\n- This option violates condition 2 because Yuki tests J.\n\nTherefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is:\n\n(D) F: Yuki, Seamus; G: Theresa, Reynaldo; H: Reynaldo, Theresa; J: Seamus, Yuki\n\nSo, the possible assignment of riders to bicycles, with the riders for each bicycle listed in the order in which they test the bicycle, is:\n\nF: Yuki, Seamus\nG: Theresa, Reynaldo\nH: Reynaldo, Theresa\nJ: Seamus, Yuki"

Therefore, the order of the first three recruits is either _ _ Quinn Peters _ _ _ or _ Quinn _ Peters _ _ _.\n3. Since Villas was recruited immediately before White, we can determine the order of the last two recruits: _ _ Quinn Peters Villas White.\n4. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao. This means that Stanton cannot be the second or sixth recruit. Therefore, the order of the recruits is either Stanton Quinn Peters Villas White Rovero or Stanton Quinn Peters Villas White _ Rovero.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statement \"If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited\":\n\nIf Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, the possible order of recruits is Stanton Quinn Peters Villas White Rovero. In this case, Stanton is the first recruit, which contradicts the statement that Stanton cannot be the first recruit. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only possible order of recruits is Stanton Quinn Peters Villas White _ Rovero.\n\nBased on this, we can determine the answer to the question: Stanton cannot have been recruited fifth.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) fifth.",

Peters was recruited fourth.\n\nWhich one of the following could be the order in which the accomplices were recruited, from first to last?\n\n(A)Quinn, Tao, Stanton, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero\n(B)Quinn, White, Rovero, Peters, Stanton, Villas, Tao\n(C)Villas, White, Quinn, Stanton, Peters, Tao, Rovero\n(D)Villas, White, Stanton, Peters, Quinn, Tao, Rovero\n(E)Villas, White, Stanton, Peters, Rovero, Tao, Quinn\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine the possible order in which the criminal recruited the seven accomplices based on the given clues.\n\nSolution: First, let's analyze the given clues:\n\n1. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.\n2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.\n3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.\n4. Peters was recruited fourth.\n\nBased on clue 4, Peters was recruited fourth. This means that Peters cannot be the first, second, or third person recruited. Therefore, Peters must be the fourth person recruited.\n\nNow let's analyze clue 2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. This means that Quinn cannot be the last person recruited, and Rovero cannot be the first person recruited.\n\nNext, let's analyze clue 3. Villas was recruited immediately before White. This means that Villas must be recruited before White. \n\nNow let's analyze clue 1. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. This means that Stanton cannot be the person recruited right before Tao or right after Tao.\n\nBased on these clues, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- Peters is the fourth person recruited.\n- Quinn is recruited before Rovero.\n- Villas is recruited before White.\n- Stanton is not recruited right before or right after Tao.\n\nNow let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) Quinn, Tao, Stanton, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero\n(B) Quinn, White, Rovero, Peters, Stanton, Villas, Tao\n(C) Villas, White, Quinn, Stanton, Peters, Tao, Rovero\n(D) Villas, White, Stanton, Peters, Quinn, Tao, Rovero\n(E) Villas, White, Stanton, Peters, Rovero, Tao, Quinn\n\nLet's go through each answer choice and see if it satisfies all the given clues:\n\n(A) Quinn, Tao, Stanton, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero\n- This order satisfies clue 4 (Peters is fourth), but it does not satisfy clue 2 (Quinn is recruited before Rovero).\n\n(B) Quinn, White, Rovero, Peters, Stanton, Villas, Tao\n- This order satisfies clue 4 (Peters is fourth), clue 2 (Quinn is recruited before Rovero), and clue 3 (Villas is recruited before White). However, it does not satisfy clue 1 (Stanton is not recruited right before or right after Tao).\n\n(C) Villas, White, Quinn, Stanton, Peters, Tao, Rovero\n- This order satisfies clue 4 (Peters is fourth), clue 2 (Qu"

Each session will be led by a different lab assistant\u2014Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\n\nIf Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session?\n\n(A)Julio, Nessa\n(B)Kevin, Rebecca\n(C)Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca\n(D)Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca\n(E)Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Rebecca\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which lab assistants could potentially lead the Thursday afternoon session, based on the given constraints and information.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the possible combinations of lab assistants for each day:\n\nWednesday:\n- Morning: \n- Afternoon: \n\nThursday:\n- Morning: \n- Afternoon: \n\nFriday:\n- Morning: \n- Afternoon: \n\nNow, let's apply the given constraints to fill in the information:\n\n1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.\n   - This means that Kevin and Rebecca cannot be assigned to different days. So, if Kevin is assigned to Wednesday, then Rebecca must also be assigned to Wednesday.\n\n2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.\n   - This means that Lan and Olivia cannot be assigned to the same day. So, if Lan is assigned to Wednesday, then Olivia cannot be assigned to Wednesday.\n\n3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.\n   - This means that Nessa must be assigned to either Thursday afternoon or Friday afternoon.\n\n4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\n   - This means that if Julio is assigned to Wednesday, then Olivia cannot be assigned to Wednesday.\n\nBased on these constraints, let's start filling in the information:\n\nWednesday:\n- Morning: \n- Afternoon: \n\nThursday:\n- Morning: \n- Afternoon: \n\nFriday:\n- Morning: \n- Afternoon: \n\nNow, let's consider the given information: Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's.\n\nIf Kevin's session is on Wednesday, then Nessa's session must be on Thursday. In this case, we can fill in the information as follows:\n\nWednesday:\n- Morning: Kevin\n- Afternoon: Rebecca\n\nThursday:\n- Morning: \n- Afternoon: Nessa\n\nFriday:\n- Morning: \n- Afternoon: \n\nNow, let's consider the constraint that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Since Kevin's session is on Wednesday, Julio's session cannot be on Wednesday. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Thursday or Friday. Let's try assigning Julio to Thursday:\n\nWednesday:\n- Morning: Kevin\n- Afternoon: Rebecca\n\nThursday:\n- Morning: Julio\n- Afternoon: Nessa\n\nFriday:\n- Morning: \n- Afternoon: \n\nNow, let's consider the constraint that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Since Julio's session is on Thursday, Olivia's session cannot be on Thursday. Therefore, Olivia's session must be on Friday. Let's assign Olivia to Friday:\n\n"

Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.\n2. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.\n3. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.\n4. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.\n\nNow, let's go through each option and see if it satisfies the constraints:\n\n(A) Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson:\n- This option satisfies constraint 1, as Frost and Heideck are assigned together.\n- It does not satisfy constraint 3, as Lai is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony when Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony.\n- It does not satisfy constraint 4, as Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.\n\n(B) Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck:\n- This option satisfies constraint 1, as Frost and Heideck are assigned together.\n- It does not satisfy constraint 3, as Lai is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony when Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony.\n- It does not satisfy constraint 4, as Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.\n\n(C) Gonzalez, Knutson:\n- This option does not satisfy constraint 1, as Frost and Heideck are not assigned together.\n- It does not satisfy constraint 3, as Lai is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony when Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony.\n- It does not satisfy constraint 4, as Heideck and Mays are not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.\n\n(D) Heideck, Lai:\n- This option satisfies constraint 1, as Frost and Heideck are assigned together.\n- It satisfies constraint 3, as Lai is assigned to the Thorne University ceremony when Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony.\n- It does not satisfy constraint 4, as Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.\n\n(E) Knutson, Mays:\n- This option satisfies constraint 1, as Frost and Heideck are assigned together.\n- It satisfies constraint 3, as Lai is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony when Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony.\n- It satisfies constraint 4,"

If one of the rugs is solid yellow, then we know that yellow is used in one rug and cannot be used in any other rug.\n2. Since yellow cannot be used in any other rug, it means that white cannot be used in any rug where yellow is used. This is because white requires two other colors to be used in the same rug.\n3. From rule 3, we know that forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug. Since one of the rugs is solid yellow, it means that forest and turquoise cannot be used in the same rug as yellow.\n4. From rule 4, we know that peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.

Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nIf Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n(B)Young is assigned parking space #2.\n(C)Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n(D)Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n(E)Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which statement could be true if Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the given rules and conditions:\n\n1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n3.

Therefore, statement (A) cannot be true.\n\n(B) Young is assigned parking space #2.\nIf Young is assigned parking space #2, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, which satisfies rule 1. This statement could be true.\n\n(C) Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\nIf Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Robertson, which violates rule 3. Therefore, statement (C) cannot be true.\n\n(D) Souza is assigned parking space #3.\nIf Souza is assigned parking space #3, then Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, which satisfies rule 2. This statement could be true.\n\n(E) Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nIf Vaughn is assigned parking space #4, then Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Vaughn, which satisfies rule 4.

Since Zircon performs before Wellspring, and Wellspring performs before Xpert, we can conclude that Vegemite must perform in a slot earlier than all three of them. Let's represent this relationship as V -> Z, V -> W, and V -> X.\n\nFinally, let's consider constraints 3 and 4. Constraint 3 states that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, and constraint 4 states that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. Since there are only six slots in total, this means that Uneasy and Yardsign must perform in slots 4, 5, or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) Uneasy performs in slot five.\n(B) Vegemite performs in slot one.\n(C) Xpert performs in slot five.\n(D) Yardsign performs in slot two.\n(E) Zircon performs in slot three.\n\nBased on the constraints we have analyzed, we can determine that option (D) Yardsign performs in slot two must be true. This is because Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, and the only option that satisfies this condition is slot two.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Yardsign performs in slot two."

Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings\n\nIf Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?\n\n(A)RealProp owns a class 1 building.\n(B)Southco owns only class 2 buildings.\n(C)Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.\n(D)Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.\n(E)Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which statement must be true if Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.\n\nSolution: First, let's analyze the initial ownership of class 2 buildings. Southco owns the Lynch Building, which is a class 2 building. Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building, both of which are class 2 buildings. \n\nNow, let's consider the possible trades that can be made:\n\n1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class: This trade does not change the number of class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp.\n\n2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings: This trade would increase the number of class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp.\n\n3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings: This trade would decrease the number of class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp.\n\nSince we know that Trustcorp cannot own any class 2 buildings after some number of trades, we can conclude that option 2 (trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings) is not possible. This means that Trustcorp cannot trade away any of its class 1 buildings.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible trades involving class 2 buildings:\n\n1. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings: This trade would decrease the number of class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp.\n\nSince Trustcorp cannot own any class 2 buildings after some number of trades, we can conclude that option 1 (trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings) must have occurred. This means that Trustcorp has traded away at least one of its class 2 buildings.\n\nBased on this information, we can determine that statement (C) Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp must be true."

This means Megregian must review Tamerlane and Undulation. However, this contradicts the statement that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, option (A) is not necessarily true.\n\n(B) Lopez reviews Undulation.\nIf Lopez reviews Undulation, then Megregian cannot review Undulation because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means Megregian must review Tamerlane and Sunset. However, this contradicts the statement that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, option (B) is not necessarily true.\n\n(C) Megregian reviews Sunset.\nIf Megregian reviews Sunset, then Lopez cannot review Sunset because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means Lopez must review Tamerlane and Undulation. However, this contradicts the statement that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, option (C) is not necessarily true.\n\n(D) Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\nIf Megregian reviews Tamerlane, then Lopez cannot review Tamerlane because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means Lopez must review Sunset and Undulation. This satisfies all the given conditions, so option (D) must be true if Jiang does not review Tamerlane.\n\n(E) O'Neill reviews Undulation.\nIf O'Neill reviews Undulation, then Kramer cannot review Undulation because exactly two students review the same play or plays. This means Kramer must review Tamerlane and Sunset. This satisfies all the given conditions, so option (E) must be true if Jiang does not review Tamerlane.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Megregian reviews Tamerlane."

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n(B) Holden's lecture is earlier than the lithographs lecture.\nThere is no direct constraint given about the order of Holden's lecture and the lithographs lecture. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n(C) The sculptures lecture is earlier than Garcia's lecture.\nThere is no direct constraint given about the order of the sculptures lecture and Garcia's lecture. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n(D) The sculptures lecture is earlier than Jiang's lecture.\nThere is no direct constraint given about the order of the sculptures lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n(E) The watercolors lecture is earlier than Garcia's lecture.\nBased on the given constraint that the oil paintings and watercolors lectures must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture, and the fact that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, we can conclude that the watercolors lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, this statement is necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) The watercolors lecture is earlier than Garcia's lecture.",

Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.\n\nWhich one of the following could be true of the photographs by Fuentes appearing in tomorrows paper?\n\n(A)One is in the Lifestyle section, one is in the Metro section, and one is in the Sports section.\n(B)One is in the Lifestyle section, and two are in the Sports section.\n(C)Two are in the Lifestyle section, and one is in the Sports section.\n(D)One is in the Metro section, and two are in the Sports section.\n(E)Two are in the Metro section, and one is in the Sports section.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine the possible distribution of photographs by Fuentes in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, based on the given conditions.\n\nSolution: Step 1: Determine the number of photographs by Fuentes in each section.\n\nAccording to the given conditions, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. This means that if Fuentes has one photograph in the Sports section, then Hue must also have one photograph in the Lifestyle section. Similarly, if Fuentes has two photographs in the Sports section, then Hue must also have two photographs in the Lifestyle section.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of photographs by Gagnon in each section.\n\nNone of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section or the Metro section.\n\nStep 3: Apply the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.\n\nIf Fuentes has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Hue must also have one photograph in the Metro section to satisfy this condition. Similarly, if Fuentes has two photographs in the Lifestyle section, then Hue must also have two photographs in the Metro section.\n\nStep 4: Determine the possible distributions of photographs by Fuentes.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the possible distributions of photographs by Fuentes are as follows:\n\n(A) One is in the Lifestyle section, one is in the Metro section, and one is in the Sports section.\n(C) Two are in the Lifestyle section, and one is in the Sports section.\n(E) Two are in the Metro section, and one is in the Sports section.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A), (C), and (E) could be true of the photographs by Fuentes appearing in tomorrow's paper."

From condition 6, we know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday, as there is already a batch of cookies made on that day.\n5. From condition 7, we know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. This means that the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday, as there is already a batch of cookies made on that day.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday. This leaves Thursday and Friday for the remaining batches.\n\nNow, let's consider the given statement: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?\n\nIf no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, it means that the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday. This means that at least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.",

So, they can be on the team together.\n\n(B) Ortega and Yoder: There are no conditions that directly restrict these two from being on the team together. So, they can be on the team together.\n\n(C) Paine and Zayre: There are no conditions that directly restrict these two from being on the team together. So, they can be on the team together.\n\n(D) Schmidt and Wong: According to the third condition, if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Since Schmidt is not mentioned in this condition, there is no restriction on Schmidt being on the team with Wong.

Grecia and Louise never work on the same day.\n   - This means that Grecia and Louise cannot work on the same day for the entire week.\n\nBased on the deductions above, we can determine the following:\n\n- Louise cannot work on Monday or Friday.\n- Grecia cannot work on Tuesday or Thursday.\n- Katya cannot work on Monday, Wednesday, or Thursday.\n- Hakeem and Joe cannot work on different days for the entire week.\n- Grecia and Louise cannot work on the same day for the entire week.\n\nNow, let's consider the given statement: If Hakeem works at the gallery on Wednesday, then Joe must work at the gallery on which one of the following pairs of days?\n\nIf Hakeem works on Wednesday, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Louise cannot work on Wednesday, as she works the second shift on two consecutive days.\n- Grecia cannot work on Wednesday, as she works the first shift on two nonconsecutive days.\n- Katya cannot work on Wednesday, as she only works on Tuesday and Friday.\n\nThis means that Joe must work on Wednesday, as he is the only student left who can work on that day.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Tuesday and Wednesday."

Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo\u2014fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\n\nIf there is exactly one bay between the bay holding machinery and the bay holding grain, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?\n\n(A)two\n(B)three\n(C)four\n(D)five\n(E)six\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine the number of bays for which the type of cargo is completely determined based on the given conditions.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the given information:\n\n1. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.\n2. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.\n3. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.\n4. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\n5. There is exactly one bay between the bay holding machinery and the bay holding grain.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement and see how it affects the determination of cargo types for each bay:\n\n1. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.\n   - This means that the bay holding grain must be either bay 5 or bay 6, and the bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 4.\n\n2. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.\n   - This means that the bay holding livestock cannot be bay 3, as that would violate statement 1. Therefore, the bay holding livestock must be bay 4.\n\n3. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.\n   - This means that the bay holding produce must be either bay 5 or bay 6, and the bay holding fuel must be either bay 1, bay 2, or bay 3.\n\n4. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\n   - This means that the bay holding textiles must be adjacent to the bay holding produce. Since the bay holding produce can only be bay 5 or bay 6, the bay holding textiles must be either bay 4 or bay 7 (which is not mentioned in the given information).\n\n5. There is exactly one bay between the bay holding machinery and the bay holding grain.\n   - This means that the bay holding machinery must be either bay 3 or bay 4, and the bay holding grain must be either bay 1 or bay 2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities based on the given information:\n\n- If the bay holding grain is bay 1, then the bay holding machinery must be bay 3, and the bay holding produce must be bay 5. However, this violates statement 3, which states that the bay holding produce must have a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, the bay holding grain cannot be bay 1.\n\n- If the bay holding grain is bay 2, then the bay holding machinery must be bay 4, and the bay holding produce must be bay "

The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.\n2. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.\n3. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.\n4. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement and see if it could be true based on the given conditions:\n\n(A) The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.\nIf the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the mirror. However, there is no condition that specifies the order of the harmonica and the mirror. Therefore, statement (A) could be true.\n\n(B) The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.\nIf the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp. However, there is no condition that specifies the order of the harmonica and the lamp. Therefore, statement (B) could be true.\n\n(C) The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.\nIf the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned before the vase. However, there is a condition that states the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, statement (C) cannot be true.\n\n(D) The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.\nIf the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp. However, there is no condition that specifies the order of the harmonica and the lamp. Therefore, statement (D) could be true.\n\n(E) The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.\nIf the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the mirror. However, there is no condition that specifies the order of the harmonica and the mirror. Therefore, statement (E) could be true.\n\nBased on our analysis, statements (A), (B), (D), and (E) could be true. Therefore, the correct answer is (A), (B), (D), and (E)."

It includes three French novels, one Russian novel, and one Russian play.\n\n(D) one Russian novel, two French plays: This option does not meet the requirement of selecting at least three but no more than four novels.\n\n(E) two Russian novels, one French play: This option does not meet the requirement of selecting at least three but no more than four novels.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) one Russian novel, one Russian play."

This means that if M is selected, both P and R must also be selected.\n\nStep 5: Determine the possible combinations of scientists for the panel.\n\nBased on the given conditions, we can determine the following possible combinations of scientists for the panel:\n\n1. F, K, P, Q, R\n2. F, L, M, P, Q\n3. G, K, P, Q, R\n4. G, L, M, P, Q\n5. H, K, P, Q, R\n6. H, L, M, P, Q\n\nStep 6: Determine which scientist(s) must be included in the panel based on the given conditions.\n\nIf both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either F or else K. This means that if G and H are selected, either F or K must also be selected.\n\nTherefore, the scientist(s) that must be included in the panel based on the given conditions are F or else K. The answer is (A) F or else K."

The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\n\nWhich one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?\n\n(A)grain\n(B)livestock\n(C)machinery\n(D)produce\n(E)textiles\n\n- The goal of this problem is to determine which type of cargo cannot be held in bay 4.\n- The expected answer is the type of cargo that cannot be held in bay 4.\n\nSolution: First, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.\n2. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.\n3. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.\n4. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\n\nNow, let's consider each option and see if it is possible for that type of cargo to be held in bay 4:\n\n(A) Grain: According to the first statement, the bay holding grain must have a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Since bay 4 is not a higher number than any other bay, grain cannot be held in bay 4.\n\n(B) Livestock: According to the first statement, the bay holding livestock must have a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Since bay 4 is not a higher number than any other bay, livestock cannot be held in bay 4.\n\n(C) Machinery: There is no specific information given about machinery, so it is possible for it to be held in any bay, including bay 4.\n\n(D) Produce: According to the third statement, the bay holding produce must have a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Since bay 4 is not a higher number than any other bay, produce cannot be held in bay 4.\n\n(E) Textiles: According to the second statement, the bay holding textiles must have a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Since bay 4 is not a higher number than any other bay, textiles cannot be held in bay 4.\n\nBased on this analysis, the type of cargo that CANNOT be held in bay 4 is (C) machinery."

Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo\u2014fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\n\nWhich one of the following could be the bay holding livestock?\n\n(A)bay 1\n(B)bay 2\n(C)bay 3\n(D)bay 5\n(E)bay 6\n\n- The goal of this problem is to determine which bay could be holding livestock based on the given conditions.\n- The expected answer is the number of the bay that could potentially hold livestock.\n\nSolution: First, let's analyze the given conditions:\n\n1. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.\n2. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.\n3. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.\n4. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\n\nBased on these conditions, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- The bay holding grain must have a higher number than the bay holding livestock. This means that the bay holding livestock cannot be bay 6, as there is no higher number bay.\n- The bay holding livestock must have a higher number than the bay holding textiles. This means that the bay holding livestock cannot be bay 1 or bay 2, as they have lower numbers.\n- The bay holding produce must have a higher number than the bay holding fuel. This means that the bay holding produce cannot be bay 1 or bay 2, as they have lower numbers.\n- The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. This means that the bay holding textiles cannot be bay 6, as there is no bay next to it.\n\nBased on these deductions, we can conclude that the bay holding livestock could be bay 3 or bay 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) bay 3 or (D) bay 5."

Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\n\nFrom condition 1, we know that Megregian reviews more plays than both Kramer and Lopez.\n\nFrom condition 2, we know that Lopez and Megregian do not review any play that Jiang reviews.

This means that there must be a pair of students who review the same play.\n\nNow, let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) Lopez: If Lopez reviews only Sunset, then Megregian must review more plays than Lopez, which contradicts condition 1. Therefore, Lopez cannot be the only student who reviews Sunset.\n\n(B) O'Neill: If O'Neill reviews only Sunset, then Kramer must review Tamerlane and Megregian must review more plays than O'Neill, which contradicts condition 1. Therefore, O'Neill cannot be the only student who reviews Sunset.\n\n(C) Jiang, Lopez: If Jiang and Lopez both review only Sunset, then Megregian must review more plays than both Jiang and Lopez, which contradicts condition 1.

It states that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, there must be another pair of students who review the same play or plays. However, since Jiang cannot review Tamerlane, the only remaining option is Megregian and Lopez reviewing the same play or plays.\n\nBased on these considerations, the only valid list of students who could be reviewing Tamerlane is (B) Kramer, O'Neill."

This answer choice states the opposite - if Kayne is assigned, then Jaramillo must also be assigned.\n\n(B) If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke.\nThis constraint does not have the same effect as the given constraint. The given constraint does not mention anything about Landon, Ong, and Novetzke being assigned together.\n\n(C) If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.\nThis constraint does not have the same effect as the given constraint. The given constraint states that if Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. This answer choice does not mention anything about Ong being assigned or not assigned.\n\n(D) Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.\nThis constraint has the same effect as the given constraint. The given constraint states that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned. This answer choice states the same thing - Jaramillo and Novetzke cannot both be assigned.\n\n(E) Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.\nThis constraint does not have the same effect as the given constraint. The given constraint does not mention anything about Novetzke and Ong being assigned together.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships."

The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n\nIf the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?\n\n(A)The optometrist is in space 2.\n(B)The pharmacy is in space 7.\n(C)A restaurant is in space 4.\n(D)The shoe store is in space 6.\n(E)The toy store is in space 3.\n\n- The goal of this problem is to determine a specific location for each of the seven businesses in the shopping center.\n- The expected answer is to identify which statement must be true based on the given constraints.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the given constraints:\n\n1. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.\n2. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.\n3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\n4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement and see if it is true or not based on the given constraints:\n\n(A) The optometrist is in space 2.\nIf the optometrist is in space 2, then the pharmacy cannot be next to the optometrist as stated in constraint 3. Therefore, statement (A) is not necessarily true.\n\n(B) The pharmacy is in space 7.\nIf the pharmacy is in space 7, then the restaurant must be in space 1 according to constraint 1. However, this violates constraint 2 which states that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, statement (B) is not necessarily true.\n\n(C) A restaurant is in space 4.\nIf a restaurant is in space 4, then the other restaurant must be in either space 1 or space 7 according to constraint 1. However, this violates constraint 2 which states that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, statement (C) is not necessarily true.\n\n(D) The shoe store is in space 6.\nThere is no constraint that directly relates to the location of the shoe store. Therefore, statement (D) could be true.\n\n(E) The toy store is in space 3.\nIf the toy store is in space 3, then the veterinarian must be in either space 2 or space 4 according to constraint 4. However, this violates constraint 3 which states that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, statement (E) is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n(D) The shoe store is in space 6."

Since the optometrist cannot be in space 1 or space 7 (because the pharmacy must be there), the optometrist and shoe store must occupy spaces 2 and 3, or spaces 5 and 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the options for the arrangement of the businesses:\n\nOption 1: Pharmacy in space 1, restaurant in space 7, optometrist in space 2, veterinarian in space 6, toy store in space 4.\nIn this option, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair (spaces 2 and 3) would be the pharmacy and a restaurant.",

Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\n2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\n3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\n4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.\n5. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) Kim works in Zone 2.\nIf Kim works in Zone 2, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 2 (according to condition 2). Therefore, this option is not possible.\n\n(B) Mahr works in Zone 2.\nThere is no information or condition that restricts Mahr from working in Zone 2. Therefore, this option is possible.\n\n(C) Parra works in Zone 3.\nIf Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must also work in Zone 3 (according to condition 3). However, there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 (according to condition 5), which means there must be at least 4 representatives in Zone 3. Since there are only 7 representatives in total, this option is not possible.\n\n(D) Tiao works in Zone 1.\nIf Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1 (according to condition 1). Therefore, this option is not possible.\n\n(E) Udall works in Zone 3.\nIf Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must also work in Zone 3 (according to condition 4). However, there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 (according to condition 5), which means there must be at least 4 representatives in Zone 3. Since there are only 7 representatives in total, this option is not possible.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that could be true is:\n\n(B) Mahr works in Zone 2."

If Wayne performs a traditional piece in the third solo, then the second solo cannot be a traditional piece (according to condition 5).

Since Wayne performs the second solo, he cannot perform the fifth solo.

The third solo is a traditional piece.\nThis means that the first two solos must be modern pieces.\n\n2. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively.\nSince the third solo is a traditional piece, there must be another traditional piece either before or after it.

Similarly, if Zara performs the second solo, she cannot perform the fifth solo.\n\n5.

This means that Wayne performs a traditional piece in the fourth solo.\n\nSince Wayne performs a traditional piece in the fourth solo, the second solo must be a modern piece (according to condition 3).

Therefore, option (A) cannot be true because it states that Image's voicemail target is 2 days, which would be longer than the other clients' voicemail targets.\n\nNow, let's consider condition 3, which states that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. This means that option (D) cannot be true because it states that Solide's website target is 2 days, which would be longer than Truvest's website target.\n\nFinally, let's consider condition 4, which states that Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target. This means that option (B) cannot be true because it states that Image's website target is 2 days, which would be longer than Truvest's website target.\n\nTherefore, the only option that must be true based on the given conditions is (E) Solide's website target is 1 day."

Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\n\nIf none of the clients has a website target of 2 days, which one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)Image's website target is shorter than Solide's.\n(B)Solide's website target is shorter than Image's.\n(C)Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's.\n(D)Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's.\n(E)Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's.\n\n- The goal of this problem is to determine which statement could be true based on the given conditions.\n- The expected answer is to identify which statement is a possible outcome based on the given information.\n\nSolution: Step 1: Analyze the given conditions:\n- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.\n- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.\n- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\n- None of the clients has a website target of 2 days.\n\nStep 2: Determine the possible combinations of targets:\n- Since none of the clients has a website target of 2 days, the possible website targets are 1 day and 3 days.\n- Since the website target of Solide must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target can only be 1 day.\n- Since none of the clients can have a website target longer than its voicemail target, Solide's voicemail target must also be 1 day.\n- Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target can only be 1 day.\n- This leaves Truvest's website target and voicemail target to be determined.\n\nStep 3: Determine the possible outcomes:\n- Based on the given conditions, the possible outcomes are:\n  1. Image's website target is shorter than Solide's.\n  2. Solide's website target is shorter than Image's.\n  3. Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's.\n  4. Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's.\n  5. Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's.\n\nStep 4: Identify the possible outcome:\n- Out of the five possible outcomes, the only one that could be true is option (A) - Image's website target is shorter than Solide's.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Image's website target is shorter than Solide's."

Q, R, S, Y, G, H, J\n2. R, Q, S, Y, G, H, J\n3. S, Q, R, Y, G, H, J\n\nSince Y is fourth, we can eliminate option (A) and (B) because J cannot be second or third.\n\nNow let's analyze the remaining options:\n\n(C) Q is first: This is possible based on the order 1. Q, R, S, Y, G, H, J. However, it is not guaranteed to be true as there are other possible orders.\n\n(D) Q is third: This is possible based on the order 2. R, Q, S, Y, G, H, J. However, it is not guaranteed to be true as there are other possible orders.\n\n(E) R is seventh: This is possible based on the order 1. Q, S, Y, G, H, J, R. However, it is not guaranteed to be true as there are other possible orders.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n(E) R is seventh."

Three of the articles\u2014G, H, and J\u2014cover finance; three other articles\u2014Q, R, and S\u2014cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\n\nIn the order in which the articles are edited, S could be in any of the following positions EXCEPT:\n\n(A)first\n(B)third\n(C)fourth\n(D)fifth\n(E)sixth\n\n- The goal of this problem is to determine the possible positions of article S in the order in which the articles are edited.\n- The expected answer is to identify the positions in which S cannot be.\n\nSolution: To determine the possible positions of article S in the order in which the articles are edited, let's consider the given conditions:\n\n1. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.\n2. S must be earlier than Y.\n3. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) First: If S is in the first position, it means that Q cannot be third since S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third. Therefore, S cannot be in the first position.\n\n(B) Third: If S is in the third position, it means that Q must be in the second position since S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third. This satisfies the condition. However, J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. If S is in the third position, it is not possible to satisfy this condition since J cannot be earlier than G. Therefore, S cannot be in the third position.\n\n(C) Fourth: If S is in the fourth position, it means that Q must be in the third position since S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third. This satisfies the condition. Additionally, J can be earlier than G, and G can be earlier than R. Therefore, S can be in the fourth position.\n\n(D) Fifth: If S is in the fifth position, it means that Q must be in the third position since S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third. This satisfies the condition. Additionally, J can be earlier than G, and G can be earlier than R. Therefore, S can be in the fifth position.\n\n(E) Sixth: If S is in the sixth position, it means that Q must be in the third position since S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third. This satisfies the condition. Additionally, J can be earlier than G, and G can be earlier than R. Therefore, S can be in the sixth position.\n\nBased on the analysis, S cannot be in the first or third positions. Therefore, the answer is (A) first."

The lectures must be given in either Gladwyn Hall or Howard Auditorium, in an order that meets the following conditions: The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall. The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.\n\nIf the third lecture is on sandpipers, which one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)The second lecture is on oystercatchers and is in Gladwyn Hall.\n(B)The fifth lecture is on oystercatchers and is in Howard Auditorium.\n(C)The second lecture is on rails and is in Howard Auditorium.\n(D)The second lecture is on terns and is in Gladwyn Hall.\n(E)The fourth lecture is on terns and is in Howard Auditorium.\n\n- The goal of this problem is to determine which statement could be true based on the given conditions.\n- The expected answer is to identify which statement is consistent with the given information.\n\nSolution: Step 1: Based on the given conditions, we know that the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. \n\nStep 2: We also know that exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. Since the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, we need two more lectures to be in Gladwyn Hall. \n\nStep 3: The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. This means that sandpipers must be one of the first three lectures, and oystercatchers must be one of the last two lectures. \n\nStep 4: The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. This means that terns must be one of the first three lectures, and petrels must be one of the last two lectures. \n\nStep 5: We are given that the third lecture is on sandpipers. This means that the first two lectures cannot be on sandpipers. \n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) The second lecture is on oystercatchers and is in Gladwyn Hall.\nIf the second lecture is on oystercatchers, then the first two lectures cannot be on sandpipers. This statement contradicts the given information, so it cannot be true.\n\n(B) The fifth lecture is on oystercatchers and is in Howard Auditorium.\nIf the fifth lecture is on oystercatchers, then the fourth lecture cannot be on oystercatchers. This statement contradicts the given information, so it cannot be true.\n\n(C) The second lecture is on rails and is in Howard Auditorium.\nThis statement does not provide any information about the order of the lectures or the location of the fourth lecture. It is possible for this statement to be true, so it is a possibility.\n\n(D) The second lecture is on terns and is in Gladwyn Hall.\nIf the second lecture is on terns, then the first two lectures cannot be on sandpipers. This statement contradicts the given information, so it cannot be true.\n\n(E) The fourth lecture is on terns and is in Howard Auditorium.\nIf the fourth lecture is on terns, then the third lecture cannot be on sandpipers. This statement contradicts the given information, so it cannot be true.\n\nBased on our analysis, statement (C) is the only one that could be true"

At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.\n5. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.\n6. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statement: \"If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then which one of the following must be true?\"\n\nIf one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, it means that the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes. This is because each photographer must have at least 1 photograph, and Gagnon and Hue are already accounted for.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. There is no direct connection between the photographers in the Lifestyle and Metro sections.\n\n(B) Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. There is no direct connection between the photographers in the Lifestyle and Metro sections.\n\n(C) Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. There is no direct connection between the photographers in the Lifestyle and Metro sections.\n\n(D) Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section being equal to the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section does not guarantee that exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.\n\n(E) Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.\nThis statement must be true. Since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and we already have one photograph by Hue in the Lifestyle section, the remaining photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.",

Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.\n\nWhich one of the following could be true of the photographs by Fuentes appearing in tomorrows paper?\n\n(A)One is in the Lifestyle section, one is in the Metro section, and one is in the Sports section.\n(B)One is in the Lifestyle section, and two are in the Sports section.\n(C)Two are in the Lifestyle section, and one is in the Sports section.\n(D)One is in the Metro section, and two are in the Sports section.\n(E)Two are in the Metro section, and one is in the Sports section.\n\n- The goal of this problem is to determine the possible distribution of photographs by Fuentes in the newspaper sections.\n- The expected answer is to identify which option among the given choices could be true for the photographs by Fuentes.\n\nSolution: Step 1: Determine the number of photographs by Fuentes in each section.\n\nLet's assume that Fuentes has x photographs in the Lifestyle section, y photographs in the Metro section, and z photographs in the Sports section.\n\nStep 2: Apply the given conditions to narrow down the possibilities.\n\nCondition 1: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of their photographs must appear.\nThis means that 1 \u2264 x \u2264 3, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 3, and 1 \u2264 z \u2264 3.\n\nCondition 2: At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.\nThis means that x \u2265 1 and y \u2265 1.\n\nCondition 3: The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.\nThis means that x = z.\n\nCondition 4: None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.\nThis means that z \u2260 0.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the given options.\n\n(A) One is in the Lifestyle section, one is in the Metro section, and one is in the Sports section.\nThis option satisfies all the conditions, as x = 1, y = 1, and z = 1. Therefore, option (A) could be true.\n\n(B) One is in the Lifestyle section, and two are in the Sports section.\nThis option does not satisfy condition 3, as x \u2260 z. Therefore, option (B) is not possible.\n\n(C) Two are in the Lifestyle section, and one is in the Sports section.\nThis option does not satisfy condition 3, as x \u2260 z. Therefore, option (C) is not possible.\n\n(D) One is in the Metro section, and two are in the Sports section.\nThis option does not satisfy condition 2, as y = 0. Therefore, option (D) is not possible.\n\n(E) Two are in the Metro section, and one is in the Sports section.\nThis option does not satisfy condition 2, as y = 0. Therefore, option (E) is not possible.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the only option that could be true for the photographs by Fuentes is option (A) - One is in the Lifestyle section, one is in the Metro section, and one is in the Sports section."

This means that Louise must work the second shift on both Monday and Tuesday.\n\nStep 2: Grecia works the first shift on two nonconsecutive days. Since Louise works the second shift on Monday and Tuesday, Grecia cannot work the first shift on either of those days. Therefore, Grecia must work the first shift on Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nStep 3: Katya works on Tuesday and Friday. Since Grecia cannot work the first shift on Tuesday, Katya must work the second shift on Tuesday. This means that Grecia must work the first shift on Wednesday.\n\nStep 4: Hakeem and Joe work on the same day as each other at least once. Since Hakeem has not been assigned a shift yet, he must work on either Monday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Let's consider each possibility:\n\n- If Hakeem works on Monday, then Joe must also work on Monday. However, this violates the condition that Grecia and Louise never work on the same day as each other.\n- If Hakeem works on Wednesday, then Joe must also work on Wednesday. This satisfies all the given conditions so far.\n- If Hakeem works on Thursday, then Joe must also work on Thursday. However, this violates the condition that Grecia and Louise never work on the same day as each other.\n\nStep 5: Now that we have determined that Hakeem and Joe work on Wednesday, we can assign their shifts. Hakeem works the second shift on Wednesday, and Joe works the first shift on Wednesday.\n\nStep 6: The only remaining day is Friday. Louise has already worked the second shift on Monday and Tuesday, so she cannot work the second shift on Friday. This means that Katya must work the second shift on Friday.\n\nStep 7: The final order of students who work the second shifts at the gallery, from Monday through Friday, is: Louise, Louise, Hakeem, Joe, Katya.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) Louise, Louise, Hakeem, Joe, Joe.",

Louise works the second shift on two consecutive days.\n   - This means that Louise cannot work on Monday or Friday, as there is no consecutive day for her to work the second shift.\n\n2. Grecia works the first shift on two nonconsecutive days.\n   - This means that Grecia cannot work on Tuesday or Thursday, as there is no nonconsecutive day for her to work the first shift.\n\n3. Katya works on Tuesday and Friday.\n   - This means that Katya cannot work on Monday, Wednesday, or Thursday.\n\n4. Hakeem and Joe work on the same day at least once.\n   - This means that Hakeem and Joe cannot work on different days for the entire week.\n\n5. Grecia and Louise never work on the same day.\n   - This means that Grecia and Louise cannot work on the same day for the entire week.\n\nBased on the deductions above, we can determine the following:\n\n- Louise cannot work on Monday or Friday.\n- Grecia cannot work on Tuesday or Thursday.\n- Katya cannot work on Monday, Wednesday, or Thursday.\n- Hakeem and Joe cannot work on different days for the entire week.\n- Grecia and Louise cannot work on the same day for the entire week.\n\nNow, let's consider the given statement: If Hakeem works at the gallery on Wednesday, then Joe must work at the gallery on which one of the following pairs of days?\n\nIf Hakeem works on Wednesday, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- Louise must work on Tuesday and Thursday (as she works the second shift on two consecutive days).\n- Grecia cannot work on Tuesday or Thursday (as she works the first shift on two nonconsecutive days).\n- Katya cannot work on Wednesday (as she works on Tuesday and Friday).\n- Joe cannot work on Wednesday (as Hakeem is already working on that day).\n\nFrom the deductions above, we can conclude that Joe must work at the gallery on Monday and Thursday.

If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.\n\nMollie must be assigned to 1922 if which one of the following is true?\n\n(A)Louis is assigned to 1924.\n(B)Onyx is assigned to 1921.\n(C)Onyx is assigned to 1924.\n(D)Tiffany is assigned to 1923.\n(E)Yoshio is assigned to 1921.\n\n- The goal of this problem is to determine which condition must be true in order for Mollie to be assigned to 1922.\n- The expected answer is to identify the specific condition that would result in Mollie being assigned to 1922.\n\nSolution: To determine which condition must be true in order for Mollie to be assigned to 1922, let's analyze the given conditions and eliminate the options that do not meet the requirements.\n\n1. Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.\n   - This means that if Mollie is assigned to 1922, Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923.\n\n2. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.\n   - This means that if Mollie is assigned to 1922, she cannot be assigned to any other year.\n\n3. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.\n   - This means that if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, Ryan must also be assigned to a year.\n\n4. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.\n   - This means that if Ryan is assigned to a year, Onyx must be assigned to the previous year.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) Louis is assigned to 1924.\n   - This option does not provide any information about Mollie's assignment, so it does not help us determine if Mollie can be assigned to 1922.\n\n(B) Onyx is assigned to 1921.\n   - This option does not provide any information about Mollie's assignment, so it does not help us determine if Mollie can be assigned to 1922.\n\n(C) Onyx is assigned to 1924.\n   - This option does not provide any information about Mollie's assignment, so it does not help us determine if Mollie can be assigned to 1922.\n\n(D) Tiffany is assigned to 1923.\n   - This option conflicts with the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922.\n\n(E) Yoshio is assigned to 1921.\n   - This option does not provide any information about Mollie's assignment, so it does not help us determine if Mollie can be assigned to 1922.\n\nBased on the analysis, the condition that must be true in order for Mollie to be assigned to 1922 is option (B) - Onyx is assigned to 1921. If Onyx is assigned to 1921, it satisfies"

Since Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, and Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, we can conclude that Zinn's audition must be the first audition.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible positions for Yoshida's audition based on the remaining conditions:\n\n- If Waite's audition is the first audition, then Yoshida's audition cannot be the first, second, or third audition since Zinn's audition must be the first audition. Therefore, Yoshida's audition must be the fifth audition.\n\nTherefore, the possible position for Yoshida's audition is the fifth position.\n\nThe answer is (A) fifth.",

Olga is a facilitator.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement and see if it must be true based on the given conditions:\n\n(A) Juana is assigned to the red team.\n- This statement could be true or false. There is no specific information given about Juana's team assignment, so it is not a must be true statement.\n\n(B) Lateefah is a facilitator.\n- This statement is not true. Lateefah is assigned to the green team, but there is no information given about her being a facilitator. Therefore, it is not a must be true statement.\n\n(C) Olga is assigned to the green team.\n- This statement is true. It is given that Olga is a facilitator, and Lateefah is assigned to the green team. Since one member of each team must be a facilitator, Olga must be assigned to the green team. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n(D) Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.\n- This statement is not true. There is no information given about Mei being a facilitator or not. Therefore, it is not a must be true statement.\n\n(E) Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.\n- This statement is not true. It is given that Olga is a facilitator, but there is no information given about Juana or Kelly being facilitators or not. Therefore, it is not a must be true statement.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is (C) Olga is assigned to the green team."

The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.\n\nWhich one of the following could be the order in which the clues are mentioned, from the first chapter through the seventh?\n\n(A)S, T, Z, X, U, W, R\n(B)T, X, U, W, S, R, Z\n(C)U, S, X, T, Z, R, W\n(D)X, U, T, Z, R, W, S\n(E)Z, R, T, U, X, W, S\n\n- The goal of this problem is to determine the possible order in which the clues can be mentioned in the mystery novel.\n- The expected answer is the correct order of the clues, following the given constraints.\n\nSolution: Step 1: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.\nThis means that T cannot be the first clue mentioned. So, option (A) is eliminated.\n\nStep 2: T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.\nThis means that T and W cannot be mentioned in consecutive chapters. So, option (B) is eliminated.\n\nStep 3: S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.\nThis means that S and Z cannot be mentioned in consecutive chapters. So, option (C) is eliminated.\n\nStep 4: W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.\nThis means that W and X cannot be mentioned in consecutive chapters. So, option (D) is eliminated.\n\nStep 5: U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.\nThis means that U and X must be mentioned in consecutive chapters. So, option (E) is the only option left.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of the clues is Z, R, T, U, X, W, S. So, the answer is (E)."

No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.\n2. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.\n3. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.\n4. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.\n5. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conditions and see if we can determine a true statement:\n\nCondition 1 tells us that each wall must have at least one oil painting displayed on it.\n\nCondition 2 tells us that each wall must have the work of at least two students displayed on it.\n\nCondition 3 tells us that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.\n\nCondition 4 tells us that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.\n\nCondition 5 tells us that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.\n\nBased on these conditions, we can determine that Greene's oil must be displayed on a different wall than Franz's watercolor. This is because condition 4 states that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, and condition 3 states that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, Greene's oil cannot be displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the true statement is:\n\n(D) Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor."

However, Southco owns the Flores Tower, not RealProp. Therefore, option (A) cannot be true.\n\n(B) The buildings owned by Southco are the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building.\nAccording to the given information, Southco owns the Flores Tower, which is a class 1 building. However, there is no mention of Southco owning the Meyer Building. Therefore, option (B) could be true.\n\n(C) The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.\nAccording to the given information, Southco owns the Flores Tower, not the Garza Tower. Therefore, option (C) cannot be true.\n\n(D) The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building.\nAccording to the given information, Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. There is no mention of Trustcorp owning the Flores Tower. Therefore, option (D) cannot be true.\n\n(E) The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.\nAccording to the given information, Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower. Therefore, option (E) cannot be true.\n\nBased on our analysis, the statement that CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made, is option (A) - The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower."

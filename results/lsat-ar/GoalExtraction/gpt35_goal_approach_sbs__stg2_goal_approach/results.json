The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.\n\nIf the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)Farley gives the watercolors lecture.\n(B)Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.\n(C)Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.\n(D)Holden gives the sculptures lecture.\n(E)Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which statement could be true given the given constraints and the fact that the watercolors lecture is third. \n\nTo approach this problem, we will use the given constraints to create a logical sequence of events and determine the possible order of the lectures.

The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.\n2. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.\n3.

Since the watercolors lecture is third, it means that the first two lectures must be either oil paintings or lithographs.\n2. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley's lecture cannot be first.\n3. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so Holden's lecture cannot be first or second.\n\nBased on these constraints, we can conclude that the first two lectures must be lithographs.

This means that Uneasy cannot perform in slots one, two, or three.\n\nLastly, we know that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. This means that Yardsign cannot perform in slots four, five, or six.\n\nBased on these constraints, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) Uneasy performs in slot five.\nIf Uneasy performs in slot five, then the only remaining slot for Zircon is slot six. However, this contradicts the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, statement (A) is not possible.\n\n(B) Vegemite performs in slot three.\nIf Vegemite performs in slot three, then the only remaining slot for Zircon is slot six. This satisfies the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, statement (B) is possible.\n\n(C) Wellspring performs in slot three.\nIf Wellspring performs in slot three, then the only remaining slot for Zircon is slot six. This satisfies the constraint that Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, statement (C) is possible.\n\n(D) Zircon performs in slot two.\nIf Zircon performs in slot two, then the only remaining slot for Vegemite is slot three. This satisfies the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, statement (D) is possible.\n\n(E) Zircon performs in slot four.\nIf Zircon performs in slot four, then the only remaining slot for Vegemite is slot three. This satisfies the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, statement (E) is possible.\n\nBased on our analysis, statements (B), (C), (D), and (E) could be true given the given constraints and the fact that Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.",

Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.\n\nWhich one of the following could be the order of the auditions, from first to last?\n\n(A)Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida\n(B)Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo\n(C)Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida\n(D)Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida\n(E)Zinn, Yoshida, Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine the possible order of the auditions based on the given conditions. To approach this problem, I would analyze each condition and use logical deductions to determine the order of the auditions.\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the condition that the fourth audition cannot be recorded. This means that the fourth audition must be either Kammer's or Lugo's, since they are the only two auditions that will be recorded. \n\nNext, let's consider the condition that the fifth audition must be recorded. Since the fourth audition cannot be recorded, the fifth audition must be either Kammer's or Lugo's. \n\nNow, let's consider the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Since the fifth audition must be recorded, Waite's audition must take place before the fifth audition. This means that Waite's audition cannot be the fourth audition, since the fourth audition cannot be recorded. Therefore, Waite's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition. \n\nNext, let's consider the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Since Waite's audition must take place before the two recorded auditions, and Kammer's audition must take place before Trillo's audition, we can deduce that Kammer's audition must be the first audition and Trillo's audition must be the second audition. \n\nNow, let's consider the condition that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Since Kammer's audition is the first audition, Zinn's audition must be either the second or third audition. \n\nFinally, let's consider the condition that the fourth audition cannot be recorded. Since Kammer's audition is the first audition and Trillo's audition is the second audition, the fourth audition cannot be Kammer's or Trillo's audition. Therefore, the fourth audition must be either Waite's, Zinn's, or Yoshida's audition. \n\nBased on these deductions, we can determine the possible order of the auditions:\n\n(A) Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida\n(B) Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo\n(C) Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida\n(D) Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida\n(E) Zinn, Yoshida, Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida."

The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.\n\nWhich one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)The table is auctioned on June 2nd and the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.\n(B)The sundial is auctioned on June 2nd and the vase is auctioned on June 3rd.\n(C)The mirror is auctioned on June 3rd and the sundial is auctioned on June 4th.\n(D)The vase is auctioned on June 4th and the sundial is auctioned on June 5th.\n(E)The sundial is auctioned on June 4th and the table is auctioned on June 5th.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which of the given scenarios could be true based on the given conditions. To approach this problem, we will analyze each condition and use logical deductions to determine the possible order of the auctions. We will then compare the order with the given scenarios to find the one that matches.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the given conditions:\n\n1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.\n2. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.\n3. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.\n4. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.\n\nNow, let's analyze each condition and make deductions:\n\n1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.\n   - This means that the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st.\n\n2. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.\n   - This condition tells us that if harmonica < lamp, then mirror < lamp.\n   - We can use this condition to make deductions later.\n\n3. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.\n   - This condition tells us that sundial < mirror and sundial < vase.\n   - We can use this condition to make deductions later.\n\n4. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.\n   - This condition tells us that table < harmonica or table < vase, but not both.\n   - We can use this condition to make deductions later.\n\nNow, let's analyze each given scenario:\n\n(A) The table is auctioned on June 2nd and the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.\n   - Based on condition 4, table < harmonica or table < vase, but not both.\n   - Since the lamp is not mentioned in condition 4, we cannot determine its position.\n   - Therefore, scenario (A) is not possible.\n\n(B) The sundial is auctioned on June 2nd and the vase is auctioned on June 3rd.\n   - Based on condition 3, sundial < vase.\n   - Based on condition 1, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st.\n   - Therefore, scenario (B) is possible.\n\n(C) The mirror is auctioned on June 3rd and the sundial is auctioned on June 4th.\n   -"

Six colors of thread are available\u2014forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow\u2014exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid\u2014woven in a single color\u2014or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.\n\nIf there are exactly two solid rugs, then the colors of those two rugs CANNOT be\n\n(A)forest and peach\n(B)forest and yellow\n(C)peach and turquoise\n(D)peach and yellow\n(E)turquoise and yellow\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which two colors cannot be used for the solid rugs, given the given rules. \n\nTo approach this problem, I would analyze each rule and eliminate the color combinations that violate those rules. Then, I would determine which combinations are left and identify the two colors that cannot be used for the solid rugs.\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the rule that states in any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. This means that if white is used in a solid rug, there must be two other colors used in that rug. \n\nNext, let's consider the rule that states in any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. This means that if olive is used in a solid rug, peach must also be used in that rug. \n\nNow, let's consider the rule that forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. This means that if forest is used in a solid rug, turquoise cannot be used in that rug. \n\nSimilarly, let's consider the rule that peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. This means that if peach is used in a solid rug, turquoise cannot be used in that rug. \n\nFinally, let's consider the rule that peach and yellow are not used together in a rug. This means that if peach is used in a solid rug, yellow cannot be used in that rug. \n\nNow, let's analyze each answer choice and see if it violates any of the rules:\n\n(A) forest and peach: This combination violates the rule that forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Therefore, this combination cannot be used for the solid rugs.\n\n(B) forest and yellow: This combination does not violate any of the rules.\n\n(C) peach and turquoise: This combination violates the rule that peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Therefore, this combination cannot be used for the solid rugs.\n\n(D) peach and yellow: This combination violates the rule that peach and yellow are not used together in a rug. Therefore, this combination cannot be used for the solid rugs.\n\n(E) turquoise and yellow: This combination does not violate any of the rules.\n\nBased on our analysis, the two colors that cannot be used for the solid rugs are (A) forest and peach."

The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.\n\nWhich one of the following is an acceptable ordering of solos from first to last?\n\n(A)violinist, percussionist, saxophonist, guitarist, trumpeter, keyboard player\n(B)percussionist, violinist, keyboard player, trumpeter, saxophonist, guitarist\n(C)violinist, trumpeter, saxophonist, percussionist, keyboard player, guitarist\n(D)keyboard player, trumpeter, violinist, saxophonist, guitarist, percussionist\n(E)guitarist, violinist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine the acceptable ordering of solos for each member of the band based on the given restrictions.\n\nTo approach this problem, I would analyze each restriction and use logical reasoning to determine the possible orderings of solos. I would start by identifying any fixed positions or relationships between certain members, and then use the remaining restrictions to narrow down the possibilities. By systematically applying the restrictions, I can eliminate incorrect orderings and eventually find the acceptable ordering of solos.\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the restriction that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. This means that the guitarist cannot be in the fourth position.\n\nNext, let's consider the restriction that the percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does. This means that the percussionist cannot be in the last position, and the keyboard player cannot be in the first position.\n\nNow, let's consider the restriction that the keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does. This means that the keyboard player cannot be in the first or last position, and the violinist cannot be in the last position.\n\nMoving on, let's consider the restriction that the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. This means that the saxophonist cannot be in the first position, and either the percussionist or the trumpeter must be before the saxophonist.\n\nBased on these restrictions, let's analyze each answer choice:\n\n(A) violinist, percussionist, saxophonist, guitarist, trumpeter, keyboard player\nThis ordering satisfies the restrictions. The guitarist is not in the fourth position, the percussionist performs before the keyboard player, the keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, and the saxophonist performs after the percussionist. This is a possible acceptable ordering.\n\n(B) percussionist, violinist, keyboard player, trumpeter, saxophonist, guitarist\nThis ordering does not satisfy the restriction that the keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist. Therefore, this is not an acceptable ordering.\n\n(C) violinist, trumpeter, saxophonist, percussionist, keyboard player, guitarist\nThis ordering does not satisfy the restriction that the keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist. Therefore, this is not an acceptable ordering.\n\n(D) keyboard player, trumpeter, violinist, saxophonist, guitarist, percussionist\nThis ordering satisfies the restrictions. The guitarist is not in the fourth position, the percussionist performs before the keyboard player, the keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, and the saxophonist performs after the percussionist. This is a possible acceptable ordering.\n\n(E) guitarist, violinist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter\nThis ordering does not satisfy the restriction that the keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist. Therefore, this is not an acceptable ordering.\n\nBased on our analysis, the acceptable ordering of solos is ("

If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.\n   - This means that if Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.\n\n4. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\n   - This means that if Landon is assigned to a country, it must be Zambia.\n\nBased on these constraints, let's consider the scenario where Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen:\n\n- If Kayne is assigned to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any country, as only one of them can be assigned.\n- Since Kayne is assigned to Yemen, Jaramillo must also be assigned to a country, according to constraint 2.\n- If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen, according to constraint 3.\n- Therefore, Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela.\n- Since Landon is not assigned to any country, according to the given information, we cannot determine if he is assigned to Zambia or not.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only statement that must be true if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen is:\n\n(E) Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship."

Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room\u2014walls 1, 2, 3, and 4\u2014with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.\n\nIf Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?\n\n(A)Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.\n(B)Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.\n(C)Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.\n(D)Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.\n(E)Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which statement must be true based on the given conditions. To approach this problem, I would carefully analyze the given conditions and use logical deductions to determine the relationships between the students, their paintings, and the positions on the walls.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the given conditions:\n\n1. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.\n2. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.\n3. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.\n4. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.\n5. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze these conditions and make some deductions:\n\nFrom condition 1, we know that each wall must have at least one oil painting.\n\nFrom condition 2, we know that each wall must have paintings from at least two different students.\n\nFrom condition 3, we know that no wall can have both Franz's and Isaacs's paintings.\n\nFrom condition 4, we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. This means that Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of that wall.\n\nFrom condition 5, we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. This means that Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.\nBased on the deductions we made, this statement is not necessarily true. We only know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position, not his oil.\n\n(B) Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.\nBased on the deductions we made, this statement is not necessarily true. We know that Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 4, so it cannot be on the same wall as Hidalgo's watercolor.\n\n(C) Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.\nBased on the deductions we made, this statement is not necessarily true. We don't have any information about the positions of Hidalgo's paintings.\n\n(D) Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.\nBased on the deductions we made, this statement is not necessarily true. We know that Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 4, so it cannot be on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.\n\n(E) Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.\nBased on the deductions we made, this statement must be true.

The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands\u2014Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.\n\nIf Veqemite performs in slot three, which one of the following must be true?\n\n(A)Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.\n(B)Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than zircon\n(C)Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy\n(D)Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than, wellspring\n(E)Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which statement must be true given the given constraints and the fact that Vegemite performs in slot three. \n\nTo approach this problem, I would analyze the given constraints and use logical reasoning to determine the possible order of the bands in the slots. Then, I would evaluate each statement to see if it aligns with the determined order.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the given constraints:\n\n1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.\n2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.\n3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.\n4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.\n\nGiven that Vegemite performs in slot three, we can make some deductions:\n\n- Since Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, Zircon cannot perform in slot three. Therefore, Zircon must perform in one of the slots four, five, or six.\n- Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Zircon cannot perform in slot three, Xpert must perform in one of the slots four, five, or six as well.\n- Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, and Xpert must perform in one of the slots four, five, or six, Uneasy cannot perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, statement (A) Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert cannot be true.\n- Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, and Vegemite performs in slot three, Yardsign must perform in one of the slots one or two.\n- Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Xpert must perform in one of the slots four, five, or six, Wellspring must perform in one of the slots one, two, or three. Therefore, statement (B) Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon must be true.\n\nBased on these deductions, we can conclude that statement (B) Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon must be true."

Nessa must lead an afternoon session.\n   - This means that Nessa's session must be in the afternoon.\n   - Since there are only two afternoon sessions (Thursday afternoon and Friday afternoon), Nessa's session must be on either Thursday afternoon or Friday afternoon.\n\n4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\n   - This means that Julio's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday, and Olivia's session must be on Thursday or Friday.\n   - Since we already know that Nessa's session must be on either Thursday afternoon or Friday afternoon, and Nessa cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia, Julio's session must be on Thursday afternoon, and Olivia's session must be on Friday.\n\nBased on these deductions, we can determine the following session assignments:\n\n- Wednesday morning: \n- Wednesday afternoon: \n- Thursday morning: \n- Thursday afternoon: Julio\n- Friday morning: \n- Friday afternoon: Olivia\n\nFrom this, we can determine the session assignments for Julio and Olivia.

Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nWhich one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?\n\n(A)#1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu\n(B)#1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu\n(C)#1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn\n(D)#1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu\n(E)#1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine the valid assignment of parking spaces to the six new employees based on the given rules. To approach this problem, I would analyze each rule and eliminate any options that violate the rules until only one valid assignment remains.\n\nSolution: First, let's analyze the given rules:\n\n1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nNow, let's go through each option and see if it satisfies all the rules:\n\n(A) #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu\n- This option violates rule 1 because Togowa has a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n\n(B) #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu\n- This option satisfies all the rules.\n\n(C) #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn\n- This option violates rule 3 because Robertson does not have a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n\n(D) #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu\n- This option violates rule 2 because Xu does not have a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n\n(E) #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn\n- This option violates rule 4 because Robertson is not assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (B) is the only one that satisfies all the given rules. Therefore, the valid assignment of parking spaces to the new employees is:\n\n#1: Vaughn\n#2: Togowa\n#3: Young\n#4: Souza\n#5: Robertson\n#6: Xu"

Seven businesses\u2014an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian\u2014will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n\nIf the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?\n\n(A)The optometrist is in space 2.\n(B)The pharmacy is in space 7.\n(C)A restaurant is in space 4.\n(D)The shoe store is in space 6.\n(E)The toy store is in space 3.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which statement must be true given the given constraints and the location of the veterinarian. To approach this problem, I would analyze the given constraints and use deductive reasoning to determine the possible locations of the other businesses. Then, I would evaluate each statement to see if it aligns with the determined locations.\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 because that would violate the constraint. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7.\n\nNext, let's consider the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Since the pharmacy is in space 7, one of the restaurants must be in space 1 or space 2. However, the optometrist cannot be in space 2 because it must be next to either the pharmacy or the veterinarian. Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 1 and one of the restaurants must be in space 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the optometrist is in space 1, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 6.\n\nBased on the constraints we have considered so far, the current arrangement is as follows:\n\n1 - Optometrist\n2 - Restaurant\n3 - \n4 - \n5 - \n6 - Veterinarian\n7 - Pharmacy\n\nNow, let's consider the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Since the veterinarian is in space 6, the toy store cannot be in space 5 or space 7. Therefore, the toy store must be in either space 3 or space 4.\n\nFinally, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n(A) The optometrist is in space 2. - This is true based on our arrangement.\n(B) The pharmacy is in space 7. - This is true based on our arrangement.\n(C) A restaurant is in space 4. - This is false based on our arrangement.\n(D) The shoe store is in space 6. - There is no information given about the shoe store, so we cannot determine its location.\n(E) The toy store is in space 3. - This is true based on our arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the statement that must be true is (E) The toy store is in space 3."

Therefore, it is possible for the guitarist to perform a solo before the saxophonist does.\n\nTherefore, statement (C) is true.\n\nMoving on to statement (D): \"The guitarist performs a solo at some time before the percussionist does.\"\n\nAccording to the given restrictions, the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. Since the keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does, it means that the guitarist performs a solo after the percussionist does.\n\nTherefore, statement (D) is false.\n\nFinally, let's analyze statement (E): \"The keyboard player performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.\"\n\nAccording to the given restrictions, the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Since there is no specific restriction regarding the order of solos between the keyboard player and the saxophonist, it is possible for the keyboard player to perform a solo before the saxophonist does.\n\nTherefore, statement (E) is true.\n\nBased on our analysis, the statement that is NOT false is (D) \"The guitarist performs a solo at some time before the percussionist does.\""

The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\n\nWhich one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.\n(B)Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.\n(C)Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.\n(D)Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.\n(E)Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which of the given statements could be true based on the given conditions. To approach this problem, I would analyze each statement and check if it satisfies all the given conditions.\n\nSolution: First, let's analyze statement (A): \"There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.\"\n\nAccording to the given conditions, Himalayans are featured on exactly three days. This means that there are only three days available for the other breeds to be featured on. Since there are three breeds of puppies (Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler), it is not possible for all four breeds to be featured on three days each. Therefore, statement (A) is not true.\n\nNow let's move on to statement (B): \"Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.\"\n\nAccording to the given conditions, Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and Himalayans are not featured on day 1. Therefore, statement (B) is not true.\n\nNext, let's analyze statement (C): \"Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.\"\n\nAccording to the given conditions, Himalayans are not featured on day 1, but Greyhounds are featured on day 1. Therefore, statement (C) is not true.\n\nMoving on to statement (D): \"Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.\"\n\nAccording to the given conditions, Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, but Himalayans are not featured on day 1. Therefore, statement (D) is not true.\n\nFinally, let's analyze statement (E): \"Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.\"\n\nAccording to the given conditions, Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Since Himalayans are not featured on day 1, Rottweilers can be featured on day 1. Therefore, statement (E) could be true.\n\nBased on our analysis, the only statement that could be true is (E): \"Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.\""

We can mark this as a flexible condition.\n\nCondition 4: The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.\nThis means that the lecture on sandpipers must be in Howard Auditorium and it must be given before the lecture on oystercatchers. We can mark this as a fixed condition.\n\nCondition 5: The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.\nThis means that the lecture on terns must be given before the lecture on petrels, and the lecture on petrels must be in Gladwyn Hall. We can mark this as a fixed condition.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options one by one and see if they satisfy all the conditions."

The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\n\nWhich one of the following must be true?\n\n(A)K is shown in the evening.\n(B)L is shown in the afternoon.\n(C)L is shown in the evening.\n(D)M is shown in the morning.\n(E)M is shown in the afternoon.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which statement must be true based on the given rules about the order and timing of showing the houses. To approach this problem, I would carefully analyze each rule and use logical reasoning to determine the possible order and timing of showing the houses. Then, I would evaluate each statement to see if it aligns with the determined possibilities.\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the rule that J must be shown in the evening. This means that J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.\n\nNext, let's consider the rule that K cannot be shown in the morning. This means that K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.\n\nNow, let's consider the rule that L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. This means that L cannot be shown in the morning, as it must be shown after K. It also cannot be shown in the evening, as it must be shown before M. Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon.\n\nBased on these rules, we can determine the following possibilities for the order and timing of showing the houses:\n\nMorning: \n1. \n2. \n\nAfternoon: \n3. L\n\nEvening: \n4. J\n5. \n6. \n7. \n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n(A) K is shown in the evening. This statement is not necessarily true, as K can be shown in the afternoon.\n\n(B) L is shown in the afternoon. This statement is true, as we determined that L must be shown in the afternoon.\n\n(C) L is shown in the evening. This statement is not true, as we determined that L must be shown in the afternoon.\n\n(D) M is shown in the morning. This statement is not necessarily true, as M can be shown in the afternoon or evening.\n\n(E) M is shown in the afternoon. This statement is not necessarily true, as M can be shown in the evening.\n\nTherefore, the statement that must be true is (B) L is shown in the afternoon."

This means that if Verma is the project leader, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be project members. \n\nNow let's consider the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. This means that if Verma is the project leader, Smith cannot be a project member because Taylor cannot be a project member. \n\nNext, let's consider the constraint that if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. This means that if Verma is the project leader, Wells cannot be a project member because neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members. \n\nBased on these constraints, we can eliminate options (A), (B), (C), and (E) because they all involve Verma being the project leader while one of the constraints is violated. \n\nThis leaves us with option (D) - Neither Smith nor Xue is selected. Let's analyze this option. If Verma is the project leader and neither Smith nor Xue is selected, it satisfies all the given constraints. Quinn and Ruiz cannot be project members because they can only be project members if they are the project leader. Taylor cannot be a project member because Smith is not selected. Wells cannot be a project member because neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. This means that the only possible project members are Verma and Xue, with Verma as the project leader. \n\nTherefore, the answer is option (D) - Neither Smith nor Xue is selected."

Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\n\nWhich one of the following must be true?\n\n(A)Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n(B)Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n(C)Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n(D)O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n(E)O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which statement must be true based on the given conditions. To approach this problem, I would carefully analyze the conditions and make deductions to determine the relationships between the students and the plays they review. Then, I would evaluate each statement to see if it is consistent with the deductions made.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the possible combinations of plays that each student could review:\n\nJiang: Sunset, Tamerlane, Undulation\nKramer: Sunset, Tamerlane, Undulation\nLopez: Sunset, Tamerlane, Undulation\nMegregian: Sunset, Tamerlane, Undulation\nO'Neill: Sunset, Tamerlane, Undulation\n\nNow, let's consider the given conditions:\n\n1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.\nThis means that Megregian must review at least two plays, while Kramer and Lopez can review at most one play each.\n\n2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\nThis means that Jiang's play(s) cannot be reviewed by Lopez or Megregian.\n\n3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\nThis means that both Kramer and O'Neill must review Tamerlane.\n\n4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nThis means that there must be two students who review the same play(s).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n(A) Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\nBased on the given conditions, we cannot determine if this statement is true or false. It is possible that Jiang reviews more plays than Lopez, but it is also possible that they review the same number of plays or that Lopez reviews more plays.\n\n(B) Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\nBased on the given conditions, this statement must be false. Since Megregian must review at least two plays, and neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, it is not possible for Megregian to review more plays than Jiang.\n\n(C) Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\nBased on the given conditions, we cannot determine if this statement is true or false. It is possible that Megregian reviews more plays than O'Neill, but it is also possible that they review the same number of plays or that O'Neill reviews more plays.\n\n(D) O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\nBased on the given conditions, we cannot determine if this statement is true or false. It is possible that O'Neill reviews more plays than Jiang, but it is also possible that they review the same number of plays or that Jiang reviews more plays.\n\n(E) O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\nBased on the given conditions, this statement must be true. Since both Kramer and O'Neill"

This means that Louise must work the second shift on both Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nBased on the restriction that Grecia works the first shift on two nonconsecutive days, we can determine that Grecia cannot work the first shift on Tuesday or Wednesday since Louise is already scheduled for the second shift on those days. Therefore, Grecia must work the first shift on Monday, Thursday, or Friday.\n\nNext, we know that Katya works on Tuesday and Friday. Since Louise is already scheduled for the second shift on Tuesday, Katya must work the second shift on Friday.\n\nNow, let's consider the restriction that Hakeem and Joe work on the same day as each other at least once. Since Hakeem has not been scheduled yet, he must work on a day when Joe is also working. This means that Hakeem cannot work on Monday or Tuesday since Grecia and Louise are already scheduled for those shifts. Therefore, Hakeem must work on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.\n\nLastly, we know that Grecia and Louise never work on the same day as each other. Since Grecia is already scheduled for the first shift on Monday, Thursday, or Friday, Louise must work the second shift on those days.\n\nBased on these restrictions, we can determine the following:\n\nMonday: Grecia (first shift), Louise (second shift)\nTuesday: Katya (first shift), Louise (second shift)\nWednesday: Joe (first shift), Hakeem (second shift)\nThursday: Grecia (first shift), Hakeem (second shift)\nFriday: Katya (first shift), Louise (second shift)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Louise, Katya, Joe, Louise, Katya.",

This means that if Mollie is not assigned to the project, she cannot be assigned to either of those years. So, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923. So, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, Louis must be assigned to 1923.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.

                            "content": "Problem Statement: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days\u2014Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday\u2014one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant\u2014Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\n\nIf Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:\n\n(A)Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.\n(B)Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.\n(C)Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.\n(D)Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.\n(E)Olivia's session meets Friday morning.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which statement cannot be true if Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions. \n\nTo approach this problem, I would first make a chart or table to organize the given information and constraints. Then, I would use the given constraints to eliminate any options that are not possible. Finally, I would analyze the remaining options to determine which one cannot be true.\n\nSolution: First, let's create a table to organize the given information and constraints:\n\n| Day       | Morning Session | Afternoon Session |\n|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Wednesday |                 |                   |\n| Thursday  |                 |                   |\n| Friday    |                 |                   |\n\nNow, let's apply the given constraints:\n\n1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.\n   - This means that Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead sessions on different days. So, if Kevin leads a morning session, Rebecca must also lead a morning session on the same day.\n\n2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.\n   - This means that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.\n\n3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.\n   - This means that Nessa cannot lead a morning session.\n\n4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\n   - This means that Julio's session cannot be on Friday if Olivia's session is on Thursday.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.\n   - This option is possible because there are no constraints that prevent Lan from leading a session on Wednesday morning.\n\n(B) Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.\n   - This option is possible because there are no constraints that prevent Lan from leading a session on Thursday afternoon.\n\n(C) Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.\n   - This option is possible because Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and Friday is the only remaining day for an afternoon session.\n\n(D) Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.\n   - This option is not possible because if Julio's session is in the morning, it must be on an earlier day than Olivia's session. Therefore, Olivia's session cannot be on Thursday morning.\n\n(E) Olivia's session meets Friday morning.\n   - This option is possible because there are no constraints that prevent Olivia from leading a session on Friday morning.\n\nBased on the analysis, the option that cannot be true if Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions is (D) Olivia's session meets Thursday morning."

The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.

Therefore, it is not possible for Trustcorp to trade away all of its class 2 buildings using this type of trade.\n\n3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings: This trade would decrease Trustcorp's ownership of class 2 buildings. Therefore, it is possible for Trustcorp to trade away all of its class 2 buildings using this type of trade.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can eliminate options (A) and (D) because RealProp owning a class 1 building or Trustcorp owning the Garza Tower does not necessarily affect Trustcorp's ownership of class 2 buildings.\n\nNext, let's consider option (B) - Southco owning only class 2 buildings. Since Southco currently owns the Lynch Building (class 2), it is not possible for Southco to own only class 2 buildings. Therefore, option (B) is not true.\n\nNow, let's consider option (C) - Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp. If Southco has made a trade with Trustcorp, it means that Trustcorp must have traded away one of its class 2 buildings. Since Trustcorp cannot trade away"

Therefore, option (A) is not possible.\n\nIf Young is assigned parking space #2, then Robertson must be assigned parking space #1 (since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young). This satisfies rule 4. Additionally, since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, Xu must be assigned parking space #3. This satisfies rule 2. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, so Togowa must be assigned parking space #4. This satisfies rule 1. Finally, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #5 and Souza must be assigned parking space #6. This satisfies all the given rules.\n\nTherefore, the unique assignment of parking spaces is determined if Young is assigned parking space #2. So, the answer is (B) Young is assigned parking space #2."

Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nThe assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if which one of the following is true?\n\n(A)Souza is assigned parking space #1.\n(B)Young is assigned parking space #2.\n(C)Vaughn is assigned parking space #3.\n(D)Robertson is assigned parking space #4.\n(E)Xu is assigned parking space #5.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine the unique assignment of parking spaces to each of the six new employees based on the given rules. \n\nTo approach this problem, I would analyze the given rules and constraints to determine the possible assignments for each employee. I would then use the process of elimination to determine which option fully and uniquely determines the assignment of parking spaces.\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the given rules:\n\n1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nBased on rule 4, we know that Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6. So, let's eliminate options (C), (D), and (E) since they assign parking space #3, #4, and #5 to Robertson respectively.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining options:\n\n(A) Souza is assigned parking space #1.\n(B) Young is assigned parking space #2.\n\nIf Souza is assigned parking space #1, then Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3 (since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young).

Therefore, option (A) is not possible.\n\nIf Young is assigned parking space #2, then Robertson must be assigned parking space #1 (since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young). This satisfies rule 4. Additionally, since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, Xu must be assigned parking space #3. This satisfies rule 2. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, so Togowa must be assigned parking space #4. This satisfies rule 1. Finally, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #5 and Souza must be assigned parking space #6. This satisfies all the given rules.\n\nTherefore, the unique assignment of parking spaces is determined if Young is assigned parking space #2.

At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\n\nIt is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\n\n(A)I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n(B)K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n(C)L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n(D)M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n(E)H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine the placement of each book on the three shelves based on the given conditions. \n\nTo approach this problem, I would analyze each condition and use logical deductions to determine the possible placements of the books. I would also use process of elimination to determine which condition fully determines the placement of the books.\n\nSolution: First, let's analyze the given conditions:\n\n1. More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n2. I is placed on the middle shelf.\n3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.\n4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.\n5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\n\nNow, let's consider each option and see if it fully determines the placement of the books:\n\n(A) If I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other:\n- This condition does not provide any information about the placement of the other books. It only tells us that I and M are together, but we don't know which shelf they are on or where the other books are placed. So, option (A) does not fully determine the placement of the books.\n\n(B) If K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other:\n- This condition also does not provide any information about the placement of the other books. It only tells us that K and G are together, but we don't know which shelf they are on or where the other books are placed. So, option (B) does not fully determine the placement of the books.\n\n(C) If L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other:\n- This condition tells us that L and F are together, but it does not provide any information about the placement of the other books. So, option (C) does not fully determine the placement of the books.\n\n(D) If M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other:\n- This condition tells us that M and H are together, but it does not provide any information about the placement of the other books. So, option (D) does not fully determine the placement of the books.\n\n(E) If H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other:\n- This condition tells us that H and O are together, but it does not provide any information about the placement of the other books. So, option (E) does not fully determine the placement of the books.\n\nBased on the analysis above, none of the given options fully determine the placement of the books. Therefore, we need to use logical deductions and process of elimination to determine the possible placements of the books."

The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.\n\nIf forest and peach are used together in a rug, which one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)There is exactly one solid rug.\n(B)White is not used in any of the rugs.\n(C)Yellow is not used in any of the rugs.\n(D)Turquoise and white are used together in a rug.\n(E)Turquoise and yellow are used together in a rug.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which statement could be true if forest and peach are used together in a rug. \n\nTo approach this problem, we will analyze the given rules and constraints to determine the possible combinations of colors for the rugs. We will then check each statement to see if it is consistent with the given information.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the given rules and constraints:\n\n1. In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.\n2. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.\n3. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.\n4. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.\n5. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"If forest and peach are used together in a rug, which one of the following could be true?\"\n\nIf forest and peach are used together in a rug, it means that both forest and peach will be used in the same rug. Let's analyze the possible combinations of colors for this rug:\n\n1. Forest, peach, and white: This combination violates rule 1 because white is used with two other colors.\n2. Forest, peach, and olive: This combination satisfies all the rules and constraints.\n3. Forest, peach, and turquoise: This combination violates rule 3 because forest and turquoise are not used together.\n4. Forest, peach, and yellow: This combination violates rule 5 because peach and yellow are not used together.\n5. Forest, peach, and any other color not mentioned in the rules: These combinations are not relevant to the given information.\n\nNow, let's check each statement to see if it is consistent with the given information:\n\n(A) There is exactly one solid rug: This statement is not necessarily true because the rug could be multicolored (e.g., forest, peach, and olive).\n\n(B) White is not used in any of the rugs: This statement is not necessarily true because white could be used in a rug with forest and peach.\n\n(C) Yellow is not used in any of the rugs: This statement is not necessarily true because yellow could be used in a rug with forest and peach.\n\n(D) Turquoise and white are used together in a rug: This statement is not necessarily true because turquoise and white are not used together in any rug.\n\n(E) Turquoise and yellow are used together in a rug: This statement is not necessarily true because turquoise and yellow are not used together in any rug.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) White is not used in any of the rugs."

Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nIf Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\n\n(A)Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n(B)Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n(C)Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n(D)Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n(E)Young is assigned parking space #2.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which statement must be true if Robertson is assigned parking space #3. To approach this problem, we will use the given rules and constraints to determine the possible assignments for each employee and then evaluate the options based on the given scenario.\n\nSolution: First, let's list the given rules and constraints:\n\n1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n4.

Since Robertson is assigned parking space #3, Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space, which means Young cannot be assigned parking space #3 or #4.\n\nBased on rule 1, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Since Young cannot be assigned parking space #3 or #4, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #2.\n\nBased on rule 2, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Since Xu cannot be assigned parking space #3 or #4, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) Souza is assigned parking space #4 - This option is not possible because Souza cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.\n\n(B) Togowa is assigned parking space #2 - This option is not possible because Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #2.\n\n(C) Vaughn is assigned parking space #5 - This option is possible because Vaughn can be assigned any parking space that is not restricted by the given rules.\n\n(D) Xu is assigned parking space #6 - This option is not possible because Xu cannot be assigned parking space #3 or #4.\n\n(E) Young is assigned parking space #2 - This option is not possible because Young cannot be assigned parking space #3 or #4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Vaughn is assigned parking space #5."

This means that Kammer's audition cannot be the last audition.\n\nCondition 5 tells us that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. This means that Zinn's audition cannot be the last audition.\n\nBased on these conditions, we can determine the following possible order of auditions:\n\n1. Waite's audition\n2. Kammer's or Lugo's audition\n3. Kammer's or Lugo's audition\n4. Trillo's audition\n5. Fifth audition (not Kammer's or Lugo's)\n6. Yoshida's audition\n\nNow, let's check each option to see if it violates any of the conditions:\n\n(A) Kammer's audition: Kammer's audition can be the second audition, as it is possible for the first audition to be Waite's audition.\n\n(B) Lugo's audition: Lugo's audition can be the second audition, as it is possible for the first audition to be Waite's audition.\n\n(C) Trillo's audition: Trillo's audition cannot be the second audition, as Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.\n\n(D) Waite's audition: Waite's audition can be the second audition, as it is possible for the first audition to be Kammer's or Lugo's audition.\n\n(E) Zinn's audition: Zinn's audition can be the second",

Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) Only Uneasy can perform in a later slot than Xpert.\nThis option does not have the same effect as the constraint involving Wellspring, Zircon, and Xpert. It only specifies the position of Uneasy relative to Xpert.\n\n(B) Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring, which performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.\nThis option has the same effect as the constraint involving Wellspring, Zircon, and Xpert. It specifies the order of Vegemite, Wellspring, and Zircon, which indirectly determines the position of Xpert.\n\n(C) Vegemite and Wellspring each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.\nThis option does not have the same effect as the constraint involving Wellspring, Zircon, and Xpert. It only specifies the position of Vegemite and Wellspring relative to Xpert.\n\n(D) Xpert performs either immediately before or immediately after Uneasy.\nThis option does not have the same effect as the constraint involving Wellspring, Zircon, and Xpert. It only specifies the position of Xpert relative to Uneasy.\n\n(E) Xpert performs in either slot five or slot six.\nThis option does not have the same effect as the constraint involving Wellspring, Zircon, and Xpert. It only specifies the possible slots for Xpert.\n\nBased on the analysis, the option that has the same effect as the constraint involving Wellspring, Zircon, and Xpert is (B) Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring, which performs in an earlier slot than Zircon."

The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.\n   - This means that the horror film and the mystery cannot be shown on the same screen.\n   - Therefore, the horror film and the mystery must be shown on different screens.\n\nBased on these deductions, we can make the following possible arrangements:\n\nArrangement 1:\n- Screen 1: Western (7 P.M.), Sci-fi (9 P.M.)\n- Screen 2: Mystery (7 P.M.), Horror (9 P.M.)\n- Screen 3: Romance (8 P.M.)\n\nArrangement 2:\n- Screen 1: Mystery (7 P.M.), Sci-fi (9 P.M.)\n- Screen 2: Western (7 P.M.), Horror (9 P.M.)\n- Screen 3: Romance (8 P.M.)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement to see if it is always true based on the possible arrangements:\n\n(A) The western begins at 7 P.M.\n   - This statement is not always true, as in Arrangement 2, the western begins at 7 P.M. on screen 2.\n\n(B) The sci-fi film begins at 9 P.M.\n  ",

Greyhounds are featured on day 1.\n2. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.\n3. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.\n4. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.\n5. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) Greyhounds are featured on days 3 and 5.\nIf Greyhounds are featured on days 3 and 5, then they cannot be featured on day 7 according to condition 3. However, this statement does not violate any other conditions. So, statement (A) could be true.\n\n(B) Newfoundlands are featured on day 3.\nIf Newfoundlands are featured on day 3, then they cannot be featured on day 2 or day 4 according to condition 2. However, this statement does not violate any other conditions. So, statement (B) could be true.\n\n(C) Rottweilers are featured on day 6.\nIf Rottweilers are featured on day 6, then they cannot be featured on day 5 according to condition 2. However, this statement violates condition 5, which states that Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans. So, statement (C) cannot be true.\n\n(D) Rottweilers are featured only on day 3.\nIf Rottweilers are featured only on day 3, then they cannot be featured on day 2 or day 4 according to condition 2. However, this statement violates condition 5, which states that Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans. So, statement (D) cannot be true.\n\n(E) Rottweilers are featured on exactly three days.\nIf Rottweilers are featured on exactly three days, then they cannot be featured on day 2 or day 4 according to condition 2. However, this statement violates condition 5, which states that Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans. So, statement (E) cannot be true.\n\nBased on our analysis, the only statement that could be true is (A) Greyhounds are featured on days 3 and 5."

Therefore, the western must be shown at 7 P.M. on either screen 1 or screen 2.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.

This means that if Ryan is assigned to 1921 or 1922, then Onyx must be assigned to 1920 or 1921 respectively. However, since the years available for the project are 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924, it is not possible for Onyx to be assigned to a year prior to 1921. Therefore, Ryan cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922.\n\nSince Ryan cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922, the condition that if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project is not applicable in this case.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that if Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Since Ryan cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922, this condition is also not applicable in this case.\n\nFinally, let's consider the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.

At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\n\nIf exactly two compositions are performed after F but before O, then R must be performed\n\n(A)first\n(B)third\n(C)fourth\n(D)sixth\n(E)seventh\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine the position of the composition R in the order of performance, given the given conditions. \n\nTo approach this problem, I would analyze each condition and use logical deductions to narrow down the possible positions for R. I would also consider the constraints and relationships between the other compositions to determine the valid positions for R.\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. This means that if T is performed before F, then R must be performed immediately after T. Similarly, if T is performed after R, then F must be performed immediately after T.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. This means that there must be at least two compositions between F and R in the order of performance. \n\nNow, let's consider the condition that O is performed either first or fifth. This means that O can only be in the first or fifth position in the order of performance.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that the eighth composition performed is either L or H. This means that L or H must be in the eighth position in the order of performance.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that P is performed at some time before S. This means that P must be performed before S in the order of performance.\n\nFinally, let's consider the condition that at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. This means that there must be at least one composition between O and S in the order of performance.\n\nBased on these conditions, we can start making deductions:\n\n- If O is performed first, then the second composition must be between O and S. However, this violates the condition that P must be performed before S. Therefore, O cannot be performed first.\n\n- If O is performed fifth, then the fourth composition must be between O and S. However, this violates the condition that P must be performed before S. Therefore, O cannot be performed fifth.\n\n- If O is performed second, third, or fourth, then there must be at least one composition between O and S. This means that S cannot be performed immediately after O. Therefore, S must be performed after O.\n\n- If S is performed after O, then P must be performed before S. Therefore, P cannot be performed after S. This means that P must be performed before O.\n\n- If P is performed before O, then the second composition must be between O and S. However, this violates the condition that at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Therefore, P cannot be performed before O.\n\nBased on these deductions, we can conclude that the given conditions are contradictory and there is no valid position for R in the order of performance."

Then, I would evaluate each statement to see if it aligns with the determined order of auction dates.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the given conditions:\n\n1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.\n2. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.\n3. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.\n4. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.\n\nNow, let's analyze each condition and make deductions:\n\nCondition 1: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.\nThis means that the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st.\n\nCondition 2: If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.\nThis condition tells us that if the harmonica comes before the lamp, then the mirror must also come before the lamp. This implies that the harmonica, mirror, and lamp must be in that order.\n\nCondition 3: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.\nThis condition tells us that the sundial must come before both the mirror and the vase.\n\nCondition 4: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.\nThis condition tells us that the table must come before either the harmonica or the vase, but not both. This means that the table cannot be the last item to be auctioned.\n\nBased on these deductions, we can create a possible order of auction dates:\n\nJune 1st: \nJune 2nd: Sundial\nJune 3rd: Mirror\nJune 4th: Vase\nJune 5th: Harmonica\nJune 6th: Lamp\n(Note: This is just one possible order, there may be other valid orders as well)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n(A) The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.\nBased on our determined order, this statement is not true. The harmonica comes after the table.\n\n(B) The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.\nBased on our determined order, this statement is true. The table comes before the lamp.\n\n(C) The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.\nBased"

Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nFor how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\n\n(A)none\n(B)two\n(C)three\n(D)four\n(E)five\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine how many of the six new employees have their assignment of a parking space limited to only two possible spaces. \n\nTo approach this problem, we will analyze the given rules and constraints to determine the possible parking space assignments for each employee. We will then count the number of employees who have only two possible spaces for assignment.\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the given rules and constraints:\n\n1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nBased on these rules, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- Since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, we can conclude that Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.\n- Since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, we can conclude that Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6, and Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n- Since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6, we can conclude that Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible parking space assignments for each employee:\n\n- Robertson: #3 or #4\n- Souza: #1, #2, #3, or #4\n- Togowa: #1 or #2\n- Vaughn: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6\n- Xu: #5 or #6\n- Young: #5 or #6\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that only Robertson has their assignment of a parking space limited to two possible spaces (#3 or #4). Therefore, the answer is (B) two."

No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\n\nWhich one of the following could be all of the solos that are traditional pieces?\n\n(A)the first, third, and fourth\n(B)the second, third, and fourth\n(C)the third and fourth\n(D)the third and fifth\n(E)the fourth and fifth\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which combination of solos could be all traditional pieces. To approach this problem, I would analyze the given conditions and use logical reasoning to eliminate options that do not satisfy the conditions.\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the condition that the third solo is a traditional piece. This means that the third solo must be a traditional piece, regardless of the other solos.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. This means that if the third solo is a traditional piece, then either the second or fourth solo must also be a traditional piece. \n\nNow, let's consider the condition that in the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. This means that if the fourth solo is a traditional piece, then Wayne must perform it. If the fourth solo is a modern piece, then Zara must perform it.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that the pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. This means that if Wayne performs the second solo, he cannot perform the fifth solo. If Zara performs the second solo, she cannot perform the fifth solo.\n\nFinally, let's consider the condition that no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. This means that Wayne must perform a modern piece before any traditional piece is performed.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) The first, third, and fourth solos are traditional pieces. This option satisfies the condition that the third solo is a traditional piece. However, it does not satisfy the condition that exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively, as the first and fourth solos are not consecutive. Therefore, option (A) is not possible.\n\n(B) The second, third, and fourth solos are traditional pieces. This option satisfies the condition that the third solo is a traditional piece. It also satisfies the condition that exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively, as the second and third solos are consecutive. However, it does not satisfy the condition that in the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece, as both Wayne and Zara would be performing traditional pieces. Therefore, option (B) is not possible.\n\n(C) The third and fourth solos are traditional pieces. This option satisfies the condition that the third solo is a traditional piece. It also satisfies the condition that exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively, as the third and fourth solos are consecutive. It also satisfies the condition that in the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece, as Wayne can perform the fourth solo. Therefore, option"

Based on this information, we can conclude the following:\n\n- Gagnon has one photograph in the Lifestyle section.\n- Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section.\n- Fuentes must have one photograph in the Sports section.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement to see if it is consistent with the determined combinations:\n\n(A) Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.\n",

This means that the fifth audition cannot be Kammer's or Lugo's, since their auditions will be recorded.\n\nFrom condition 3, we know that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Since the fifth audition must be recorded, Waite's audition cannot be the fifth audition. Therefore, Waite's audition must be either the first, second, third, or fourth audition.\n\nFrom condition 4, we know that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Since the fourth audition cannot be recorded, Kammer's audition cannot be the fourth audition. Therefore, Kammer's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition.\n\nFrom condition 5, we know that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Since Kammer's audition is immediately before Yoshida's, Zinn's audition cannot be the first audition. Therefore, Zinn's audition must be either the second or third audition.\n\nNow, let's consider each statement and see if it is consistent with the determined order:\n\n(A) Kammer's audition is second.\nIf Kammer's audition is second, then Zinn's audition must be the first audition. But we already determined that Zinn's audition cannot be the first audition. Therefore, statement (A) is not true.\n\n(B) Trillo's audition is fourth.\nIf Trillo's audition is fourth, then Kammer's audition must be the third audition. But we already determined that Kammer's audition cannot be the fourth audition. Therefore, statement (B) is not true.\n\n(C) Waite's audition is third.\nIf Waite's audition is third, then Kammer's audition must be the second audition and Zinn's audition must be the first audition"

The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.\n\nWhich one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.\n(B)The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.\n(C)The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.\n(D)The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.\n(E)The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to determine which of the given statements could be true based on the given conditions. To approach this problem, we will analyze the given conditions and determine the possible order of auctioning the antiques. Then, we will check each statement against the determined order to see if it is possible or not.\n\nSolution: First, let's analyze the given conditions:\n\n1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.\n2. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.\n3. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.\n4. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.\n\nBased on these conditions, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th.\n- If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the lamp. This means that the harmonica, mirror, and lamp must be auctioned in that order.\n- The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase, so it must be auctioned before June 2nd.\n- The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, so it must be auctioned before June 2nd.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.\nIf the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp. However, based on the deductions we made, the harmonica must be auctioned before the mirror. Therefore, statement (A) is not possible.\n\n(B) The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.\nIf the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp. This is possible based on the deductions we made. Therefore, statement (B) is possible.\n\n(C) The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.\nIf the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned before the vase. However, based on the deductions we made, the sundial must be auctioned before June 2nd. Therefore, statement (C) is not possible.\n\n(D) The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.\nIf the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp. This is possible based on the deductions we made. Therefore, statement (D)"

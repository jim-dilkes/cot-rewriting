Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Olivia, George, and Nina.\n\nSo the answer is (A) Helen, George, and Nina."

George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, George cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.\n\n2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Therefore, Olivia and Robert cannot give reports on Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon.\n\n3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. If Nina does not give a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Wednesday.\n\n4. Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday. This means that Kyle cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday afternoon.\n\n5. Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday. This means that Helen cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday afternoon.\n\nNow, let's use this information to determine the possible list of students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:\n\n- Monday morning: There are 8 students and 6 reports, so 2 students will not give reports. Based on the given information, George cannot give a report on Monday, and Helen cannot give a report on Monday morning. This means that George and Helen are the two students who do not give reports on Monday. Therefore, the possible options for Monday morning are: Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.\n\n- Tuesday morning: George can only give a report on Tuesday, so George must give a report on Tuesday morning. This leaves us with 5 students and 5 reports remaining. Based on the given information, Kyle cannot give a report on Tuesday morning. Therefore, the possible options for Tuesday morning are: Irving,",

This means that George and Helen are the two students who do not give reports on Monday. Therefore, the possible options for Monday morning are: Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.\n\n- Tuesday morning: George can only give a report on Tuesday, so George must give a report on Tuesday morning.

Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.\nThis option is not possible because there are only three breeds of kittens and three breeds of puppies, so there cannot be four breeds featured on three days each.\n\n(B) Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.\nThis option is not possible because Himalayans are not featured on day 1, but Greyhounds are.\n\n(C) Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.\nThis option is not possible because Himalayans are not featured on day 1, but Greyhounds are.\n\n(D) Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.\nThis option is possible. Let's check if it satisfies all the given conditions:\n- Greyhounds are featured on day 1, and Himalayans are not featured on day 1.\n- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.\n- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.\n- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.\n- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\n\n(E) Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.\nThis option is not possible because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, but Himalayans are not featured on day 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not."

Therefore, M cannot be selected because P is the only zoologist selected.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining scientists:\n\nBotanists: F, G, H\nChemists: K, L\nZoologists: Q\n\nSince we need to have at least one scientist of each type, we can conclude that F or G must be selected.\n\nNow, let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) If K is selected, G cannot be selected.\nThis statement is not necessarily true because G can still be selected even if K is selected.\n\n(B) If L is selected, F cannot be selected.\nThis statement is not necessarily true because F can still be selected even if L is selected.\n\n(C) If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.\nThis statement is not necessarily true because L can be selected as the only chemist.\n\n(D) If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.\nThis statement is not necessarily true because F can still be selected even if two chemists are selected.\n\n(E) If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.\nThis statement is true because if two chemists are selected, one of them must be K (due to condition 3), and if K is selected, G cannot be selected (due to condition 3).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected."

This means fuel can only be in bay 1, bay 2, or bay 3. \n\nNext, we know that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Since textiles can only be in bay 3 or bay 5, livestock must be in one of the bays with a higher number than 3 or 5. This means livestock can only be in bay 4, bay 5, or bay 6. \n\nFinally, we know that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.

Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Tuesday or Wednesday. Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, this means that the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining batches of cookies. We know that the first batch of oatmeal cookies, the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the first batch of sugar cookies are all made on Monday. Therefore, the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday or Wednesday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday or Thursday. Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, this means that the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information we have:\n\nMonday: oatmeal, peanut butter, sugar\nTuesday: sugar\nWednesday: oatmeal, peanut butter\nThursday: oatmeal, sugar\nFriday: peanut butter, sugar\n\nNow, let's count the number of days where at most two batches of cookies could be made. From the information above, we can see that on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday, there are at most two batches of cookies made. Therefore, the answer is (C) three."

Therefore, this statement is not possible.\n\n(B) O'Neill does not review Undulation.\nIf O'Neill does not review Undulation, then the three students who review Undulation must be Jiang, Kramer, and Lopez. This is possible and does not violate any of the given conditions. Therefore, this statement could be true.\n\n(C) Jiang reviews Undulation.\nIf Jiang reviews Undulation, then the other two students who review Undulation must be Kramer and Lopez. However, this violates the condition that Lopez does not review any play that Jiang reviews. Therefore, this statement is not possible.\n\n(D) Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\nIf Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then the other student who reviews Tamerlane must be O'Neill. However, this violates the condition that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, this statement is not possible.\n\n(E) O'Neill reviews Sunset.\nIf O'Neill reviews Sunset, then the other student who reviews Sunset must be Kramer. However, this violates the condition that exactly two students review the same play or plays. Therefore, this statement is not possible.\n\nBased on our analysis, the only statement that could be true is (B) O'Neill does not review Undulation."

Therefore, option (B) is not true.\n\n(C) Vaughn is assigned parking space #3.\nIf Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, then Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, which means Robertson can only be assigned parking space #4. This satisfies rule 4. However, it does not provide any information about the assignment of parking spaces for Xu, Togowa, and Souza. Therefore, option (C) is not true.\n\n(D) Robertson is assigned parking space #4.\nIf Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, which satisfies rule 1. Additionally, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, which satisfies rule 2. This also satisfies rule 3 since Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, option (D) is true.\n\n(E) Xu is assigned parking space #5.\nIf Xu is assigned parking space #5, then Souza must be assigned parking space #4, which violates rule 2. Therefore, option (E) is not true.\n\nBased on our analysis, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4. Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."

Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nIf Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n(B)Young is assigned parking space #2.\n(C)Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n(D)Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n(E)Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the rules and constraints given:\n\n1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\nIf Togowa is assigned parking space #1, then Young cannot be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, which violates rule 1. Therefore, option (A) is not possible.\n\n(B) Young is assigned parking space #2.\nIf Young is assigned parking space #2, then Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, which violates rule 1. Therefore, option (B) is not possible.\n\n(C) Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\nIf Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Robertson, which violates rule 3. Therefore, option (C) is not possible.\n\n(D) Souza is assigned parking space #3.\nIf Souza is assigned parking space #3, then Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, which violates rule 2. Therefore, option (D) is not possible.\n\n(E) Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nIf Vaughn is assigned parking space #4, then Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Vaughn, which is possible according to the given rules. Therefore, option (E) could be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (E) Vaughn is assigned parking space #4."

Therefore, Seamus must test either F or G on the first day.\n- Reynaldo cannot test F, so if Seamus tests F on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test on the second day. Therefore, Seamus cannot test F on the first day.\n- This means that Seamus must test G on the first day.\n- Since Seamus is testing G on the first day, Yuki cannot test G on the first day. Therefore, Yuki must test either F or H on the first day.\n- If Yuki tests F on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test on the second day. Therefore, Yuki cannot test F on the first day.\n- This means that Yuki must test H on the first day.\n- Since Yuki is testing H on the first day, Theresa cannot test H on the first day. Therefore, Theresa must test F on the first day.\n\nBased on this scenario, we can determine the following:\n\n- Reynaldo tests G on the second day. (A) is true.\n- Seamus tests H on the first day. (B) is true.\n- Yuki tests H on the second day. (C) is false.\n- Seamus is one of the testers for J. (D) is false.\n- Theresa is one of the testers for G. (E) is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Reynaldo tests G on the second day."

This means that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants will be in spaces 1 and 7, but we don't know the exact order yet.\n\nNext, we know that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means that the two restaurants cannot be in spaces 2 and 3, or spaces 5 and 6. So, let's consider the possible locations for the two restaurants:\n\n- If the two restaurants are in spaces 3 and 5, then the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. However, in this case, the pharmacy would be next to the toy store, which is not allowed. So, this option is not possible.\n\n- If the two restaurants are in spaces 4 and 6, then the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Let's consider the possible orders for these three businesses: pharmacy, optometrist, veterinarian or pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist.\n\nNow, we know that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. So, if the order is pharmacy, optometrist, veterinarian, then the toy store cannot be in space 6. This means that the order cannot be (A) or (B).\n\nLet's consider the order pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist. In this case, the toy store can be in space 6, and the shoe store can be in space 5. The only option that matches this order is (C).\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant."

Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

This means that if Parra works in Zone 1, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, and vice versa.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.

Therefore, this statement is not possible.\n\n(B) Mahr works in Zone 2.\nThere is no information given about Mahr's placement in any of the conditions. Therefore, this statement is possible.\n\n(C) Parra works in Zone 3.\nIf Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must also work in Zone 3. However, the condition states that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, this statement is not possible.\n\n(D) Tiao works in Zone 1.\nIf Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1. However, the condition states that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, this statement is not possible.\n\n(E) Udall works in Zone 3.\nIf Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must also work in Zone 3. However, the condition states"

This means that if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn must also be in Zone 1. If Parra is in Zone 3, then Quinn must also be in Zone 3.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider the condition that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. This means that if Stuckey is in Zone 2, then Udall must also be in Zone 2. If Stuckey is in Zone 3, then Udall must also be in Zone 3.\n\nLastly, we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nNow, let's go through the answer choices one by one and see if they satisfy all the conditions:\n\n(A) Kim, Mahr: This choice does not satisfy the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\n\n(B) Kim, Tiao: This choice satisfies the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. However, it does not satisfy the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\n\n(C) Parra, Quinn: This choice satisfies the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. However, it does not satisfy the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\n\n(D) Stuckey, Tiao, Udall: This choice satisfies the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. It also satisfies the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. However, it does not satisfy the condition that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\n\n(E) Parra, Quinn, Stuck"

Since Wayne performs the second solo, he cannot perform the fifth solo. This means that Zara must perform the fifth solo.\n\nBased on these conditions, we can conclude that Zara performs the first solo (since Wayne must perform a modern piece), Wayne performs the third solo (since Zara performs the second solo and it must be a traditional piece), Zara performs the fifth solo (since Wayne cannot perform it), and the second solo is a traditional piece (since Wayne performs the fourth solo and it must be a traditional piece).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) The second solo is a traditional piece."

Q, R, S, G, H, J, Y\n2. R, Q, S, G, H, J, Y\n3. S, Q, R, G, H, J, Y\n\nSince Y is fourth, we can eliminate option (A) because J cannot be second in any of the possible orders.\n\nNow let's consider option (B) - J is third. In order for J to be third, the order would have to be:\n\n1. Q, R, J, S, G, H, Y\n\nHowever, this violates the condition that J must be earlier than G. Therefore, option (B) is not true.\n\nNext, let's consider option (C) - Q is first. In order for Q to be first, the order would have to be:\n\n1. Q, R, S, G, H, J, Y\n\nThis order satisfies all the given conditions, so option (C) is true.\n\nNow let's consider option (D) - Q is third. In order for Q to be third, the order would have to be:\n\n1. R, S, Q, G, H, J, Y\n\nHowever, this violates the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, option (D) is not true.\n\nFinally, let's consider option (E) - R is seventh. In order for R to be seventh, the order would have to be:\n\n1. Q, S, G, H, J, Y, R\n\nHowever, this violates the condition that G must be earlier than R. Therefore, option (E) is not true.\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct answer is option (C) - Q is first."

The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.\n\nWhich one of the following is an acceptable schedule of the movies for this evening?\n\n(A)screen 1: romance at 7 P.M., horror film at 9 P.M. screen 2: western at 7 P.M., sci-fi film at 9 P.M. screen 3: mystery at 8 P.M.\n(B)screen 1: mystery at 7 P.M., romance at 9 P.M. screen 2: horror film at 7 P.M., sci-fi film at 9 P.M. screen 3: western at 8 P.M.\n(C)screen 1: western at 7 P.M., sci-fi film at 9 P.M. screen 2: mystery at 7 P.M., horror film at 9 P.M. screen 3: romance at 8 P.M.\n(D)screen 1: romance at 7 P.M., mystery at 9 P.M. screen 2: western at 7 P.M., horror film at 9 P.M. screen 3: sci-fi film at 8 P.M.\n(E)screen 1: western at 7 P.M., mystery at 9 P.M. screen 2: sci-fi film at 7 P.M., romance at 9 P.M. screen 3: horror film at 8 P.M.\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the condition that the western begins before the horror film.

This means that the horror film and the mystery cannot both be shown on screen 1 or screen 2. Therefore, one of them must be shown on screen 3.\n\nBased on these conditions, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) the sci-fi film, the horror film\nIn this option, the horror film is shown on screen 1 and the sci-fi film is shown on screen 2. This is possible, so option (A) could be an accurate list.\n\n(B) the sci-fi film, the mystery\nIn this option, the mystery is shown on screen 1 and the sci-fi film is shown on screen 2. This is possible, so option (B) could be an accurate list.\n\n(C) the western, the horror film\nIn this option, the horror film is shown on screen 1 and the western is shown on screen 2. This is possible, so option (C) could be an accurate list.\n\n(D) the western, the mystery\nIn this option, the mystery is shown on screen 1 and the western is shown on screen 2. This is possible, so option (D) could be an accurate list.\n\n(E) the western, the sci-fi film\nIn this option, the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1 and the western is shown on screen 2. However, based on the conditions, the western cannot be shown on screen 2. Therefore, option (E) cannot be an accurate list.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) the western, the sci-fi film."

Therefore, the saxophonist must perform the second or third solo.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining members - the trumpeter and the violinist. The trumpeter must perform a solo before the saxophonist, so they cannot perform the last solo. Therefore, the trumpeter must perform the first or second solo. The violinist must perform a solo before the keyboard player, so they cannot perform the first solo. Therefore, the violinist must perform the second solo.\n\nBased on these restrictions, we can determine the following order of solos: \n\n1. Trumpeter\n2. Violinist\n3. Percussionist\n4. Keyboard player\n5. Saxophonist\n6. Guitarist\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n(A) The keyboard player performs the first solo. - False, as we determined that the keyboard player performs the fourth solo.\n\n(B) The guitarist performs the second solo. - True, as we determined that the guitarist performs the sixth solo.\n\n(C) The guitarist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does. - True, as the guitarist performs the sixth solo and the saxophonist performs the fifth solo.\n\n(D) The guitarist performs a solo at some time before the percussionist does. - False, as the guitarist performs the sixth solo and the percussionist performs the third solo.\n\n(E) The keyboard player performs a solo at some time before the sax"

If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.\n\nWhich one of the following CANNOT be the complete assignment of photographers to the Thorne University ceremony?\n\n(A)Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Mays\n(B)Frost, Heideck, Knutson, Mays\n(C)Gonzalez, Knutson, Lai\n(D)Gonzalez, Knutson, Mays\n(E)Knutson, Mays\n\nSolution: First, let's analyze the given constraints:\n\n1. Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.\n2. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.\n3. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.\n4. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.\n\nNow, let's go through each option and see if it satisfies all the constraints:\n\n(A) Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Mays\n- This assignment satisfies all the constraints. Frost and Heideck are assigned together, Lai and Mays are assigned to different ceremonies, and Gonzalez is not assigned to the Silva University ceremony.\n\n(B) Frost, Heideck, Knutson, Mays\n- This assignment satisfies all the constraints. Frost and Heideck are assigned together, Lai and Mays are assigned to different ceremonies, and Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.\n\n(C) Gonzalez, Knutson, Lai\n- This assignment satisfies all the constraints. Frost and Heideck are not assigned, Lai and Mays are assigned to different ceremonies, and Gonzalez is not assigned to the Silva University ceremony.\n\n(D) Gonzalez, Knutson, Mays\n- This assignment satisfies all the constraints. Frost and Heideck are not assigned, Lai and Mays are assigned to different ceremonies, and Gonzalez is not assigned to the Silva University ceremony.\n\n(E) Knutson, Mays\n- This assignment violates constraint 4. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. However, Heideck is not assigned in this option.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) Knutson, Mays."

None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.\n\nIf one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then which one of the following must be true?\n\n(A)Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.\n(B)Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.\n(C)Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.\n(D)Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.\n(E)Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. This means that either Gagnon or Hue must have a photograph in the Metro section.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there are no photographs by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, there must be no photographs by Fuentes in the Sports section either.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Since there are no photographs by Fuentes in the Sports section, and Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, it means that both photographs in the Sports section must be by Hue.\n\nBased on these conditions, we can conclude that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. Therefore, the answer is (E) Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue."

Each day is divided into two nonoverlapping shifts\u2014first and second\u2014with each student working exactly two shifts. Each shift is worked by exactly one of the students according to the following scheduling restrictions: No student works both shifts of any day. On two consecutive days, Louise works the second shift. On two nonconsecutive days, Grecia works the first shift. Katya works on Tuesday and Friday. Hakeem and Joe work on the same day as each other at least once. Grecia and Louise never work on the same day as each other.\n\nIf Hakeem works at the gallery on Wednesday, then Joe must work at the gallery on which one of the following pairs of days?\n\n(A)Monday and Wednesday\n(B)Monday and Thursday\n(C)Tuesday and Wednesday\n(D)Tuesday and Thursday\n(E)Wednesday and Thursday\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the scheduling restrictions given in the problem:\n\n1. Louise works the second shift on two consecutive days.\n2. Grecia works the first shift on two nonconsecutive days.\n3. Katya works on Tuesday and Friday.\n4. Hakeem and Joe work on the same day at least once.\n5. Grecia and Louise never work on the same day.\n\nFrom restriction 1, we know that Louise works the second shift on two consecutive days. This means that Louise cannot work on Monday or Friday, as there is no consecutive day for her to work the second shift.\n\nFrom restriction 2, we know that Grecia works the first shift on two nonconsecutive days. This means that Grecia cannot work on Tuesday or Thursday, as there is no nonconsecutive day for her to work the first shift.\n\nFrom restriction 3, we know that Katya works on Tuesday and Friday.\n\nFrom restriction 4, we know that Hakeem and Joe work on the same day at least once. Since Hakeem works on Wednesday, Joe must also work on Wednesday.\n\nFrom restriction 5, we know that Grecia and Louise never work on the same day. Since Grecia cannot work on Tuesday or Thursday, and Louise cannot work on Monday or Friday, the only possible day for Grecia and Louise to work together is Wednesday.\n\nBased on the above deductions, we can conclude that Joe must work at the gallery on Tuesday and Wednesday. Therefore, the answer is (C) Tuesday and Wednesday."

If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring\n\nWhich one of the following, if substituted for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks?\n\n(A)If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.\n(B)If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.\n(C)If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.\n(D)If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.\n(E)If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.\n\nSolution: First, let's analyze the given conditions:\n\n1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.\n2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.\n3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.\n4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.\n\nNow, let's consider each answer choice and see if it has the same effect as the given condition:\n\n(A) If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.\nThis condition does not have the same effect as the given condition. It does not provide any information about N.\n\n(B) If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.\nThis condition does not have the same effect as the given condition. It does not provide any information about M.\n\n(C) If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.\nThis condition does not have the same effect as the given condition. It does not provide any information about N.\n\n(D) If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.\nThis condition has the same effect as the given condition. If N is published in the spring, it implies that M must also be published in the spring.\n\n(E) If O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.\nThis condition does not have the same effect as the given condition. It does not provide any information about M.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring."

However, this violates condition 4, which states that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Therefore, option (A) is not possible.\n\n(B) Trillo's audition is fourth.\nIf Trillo's audition is fourth, then the fourth audition cannot be recorded. However, condition 2 states that the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, option (B) is not possible.\n\n(C) Waite's audition is third.\nIf Waite's audition is third, then the fourth audition cannot be recorded. However, condition 2 states that the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, option (C) is not possible.\n\n(D) Yoshida's audition is sixth.\nIf Yoshida's audition is sixth, then Zinn's audition must be fifth. However, condition 2 states that the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, option (D) is not possible.\n\n(E) Zinn's audition is second.\nIf Zinn's audition is second, then Kammer's audition must be first. This satisfies condition 4, which states that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Additionally, Trillo's audition can be fourth, Waite's audition can be third, and Yoshida's audition can be sixth. This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, option (E) is possible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) Zinn's audition is second."

Therefore, this option is valid.\n\n(C) U is mentioned in chapter 7.\nAccording to constraint 5, U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Since X is not mentioned in this option, it is not possible for U to be mentioned in chapter 7. Therefore, this option is not valid.\n\n(D) W is mentioned in chapter 3.\nAccording to constraint 2, T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating them. If W is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 2, which violates constraint 1. Therefore, this option is not valid.\n\n(E) X is mentioned in chapter 6.\nAccording to constraint 5, U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. If X is mentioned in chapter 6, then U must be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 7, which violates constraint 3. Therefore, this option is not valid.\n\nBased on our analysis, the only valid option is (B) T is mentioned in chapter 5."

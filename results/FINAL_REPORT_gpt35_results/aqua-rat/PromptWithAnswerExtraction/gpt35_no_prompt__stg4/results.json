The percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. Since 1 out of 20 marbles pulled out the second time was black, we can conclude that the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 1/20 * 100% = 5%.\n\n4. Let's assume the total number of marbles in the bag is Q. Since the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5%, the number of black marbles in the bag is 5% of Q, which is 0.05Q.\n\n5. We know that there is currently 1 black marble in the bag, so we can set up the equation 0.05Q = 1.\n\nSolving this equation, we find that Q = 1 / 0.05 = 20.\n\nTherefore, the bag currently holds 20 marbles in total.\n\nAnswer: (A) 40",

In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? (A)21 (B)30 (C)31 (D)32 (E)None of the above\n\nAnswer: To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold and divide it by 22.\n\nIn the first 10 months, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month. So, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months is 20 * 10 = 200.\n\nIn the remaining 12 months, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month is 42.\n\nSo, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the remaining 12 months is 42 * 12 = 504.\n\nTherefore, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the entire 22-month period is 200 + 504 = 704.\n\nThe average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 704 / 22 = 32.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 32."

We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nSum = (n/2)(first term + last term)\n\nSince we have 5 consecutive numbers, n = 5. The first term is the smallest odd number, which is 41, and the last term is the largest odd number, which is 49.\n\nSum = (5/2)(41 + 49)\nSum = (5/2)(90)\nSum = 225\n\nNow, we need to check if 225 is divisible by 10 and a perfect square.\n\n225 is divisible by 10 because it ends in a 5, which means it is divisible by 5. Since it is divisible by 5, it is also divisible by 10.\n\nTo check if 225 is a perfect square, we can take the square root of 225. The square root of 225 is 15, which is a whole number. Therefore, 225 is a perfect square.\n\nNow, let's check which of the given numbers can be one of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers.\n\n(A) 47: This number is not odd, so it cannot be one of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers.\n\n(B) 91: This number is not two-digit, so it cannot be one of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers.\n\n(C) 41: This number is the smallest odd number, so it can be one of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers.\n\n(D) 67: This number is not odd, so it cannot be one of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers.\n\n(E) 44: This number is not odd, so it cannot be one of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 41.",

We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nSum = (n/2)(first term + last term)\n\nSince we have 5 consecutive numbers, n = 5. The first term is the smallest odd number, which is 41, and the last term is the largest odd number, which is 49.\n\nSum = (5/2)(41 + 49)\nSum = (5/2)(90)\nSum = 225\n\nNow, we need to check if 225 is divisible by 10 and a perfect square.\n\n225 is divisible by 10 because it ends in a 5, which means it is divisible by 5. Since it is divisible by 5, it is also divisible by 10.\n\nTo check if 225 is a perfect square, we can take the square root of 225. The square root of 225 is 15, which is a whole number. Therefore, 225 is a perfect square.\n\nNow, let's check which of the given numbers can be one of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers.\n\n(A) 47: This number is not odd, so it cannot be one of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers.\n\n(B) 91: This number is not two-digit, so it cannot be one of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers.\n\n(C) 41: This number is the smallest odd number, so it can be one of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers.\n\n(D) 67: This number is not odd, so it cannot be one of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers.\n\n(E) 44: This number is not odd, so it cannot be one of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 41."

The smallest number of letters needed to create 676 codes is 4 (since 26^2 = 676). Therefore, the answer is (B) 4."

Now he must sell the items at original price the other day. By what percentage must he increase the price to original? (A)21% (B)20% (C)25% (D)33% (E)18%\n\nAnswer: To find the percentage increase needed to return to the original price, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage increase = (Original price - Discounted price) / Discounted price * 100\n\nSince the shopkeeper applied a 20% discount, the discounted price is 80% of the original price. Therefore, the formula becomes:\n\nPercentage increase = (Original price - 0.8 * Original price) / 0.8 * Original price * 100\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nPercentage increase = (0.2 * Original price) / 0.8 * Original price * 100\n\nPercentage increase = 0.25 * 100\n\nPercentage increase = 25%\n\nTherefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to return to the original price.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) 25%."

During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? (A)300 (B)500 (C)5000 (D)6000 (E)7500\n\nAnswer: Let's assume the total deer population in the forest is x.\n\nIn 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned. This means that the proportion of tagged deer in the forest after 2001 is 300/x.\n\nIn 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. This means that the proportion of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample is 20/500.\n\nAccording to the given information, the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(20/500) = (300/x)\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\n20x = 500 * 300\n20x = 150,000\nx = 150,000 / 20\nx = 7,500\n\nTherefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7,500.\n\nThe answer is (E) 7,500."

Therefore, a can take values from 1 to 9.\n\n2. Since N is the reverse of M, c must be greater than 0. Therefore, c can take values from 1 to 9.\n\n3. For each combination of a and c, we can calculate the corresponding values of b, M, and N.\n\n4. We can then check if M is greater than 300. If it is, we count it as one of the values that satisfy the condition.\n\nLet's go through the possible values of a and c:\n\nFor a = 1:\n- c can take values from 1 to 9.\n- For each value of c, we can calculate the corresponding values of b, M, and N.\n- If M is greater than 300, we count it.\n\nFor a = 2:\n- c can take values from 1 to 9.\n- For each value of c, we can calculate the corresponding values of b, M, and N.\n- If M is greater than 300, we count it.\n\n...\n\nFor a = 9:\n- c can take values from 1 to 9.\n- For each value of c, we can calculate the corresponding values of b, M, and N.\n- If M is greater than 300, we count it.\n\nBy going through all the possible values of a and c, we can count the total number of values of M that are more than 300.\n\nSince there are 9 possible values of a and 9 possible values of c, the total number of values of M that satisfy the condition is 9 * 9 = 81.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) None, as there are no values of M that are more than 300."

This can be arranged in 2 ways: Tim in the middle chair and Zen in the rightmost chair, or Zen in the middle chair and Tim in the rightmost chair.\n\nIf Susan is in the middle chair, there is only one way to arrange Tim and Zen: Tim in the leftmost chair and Zen in the rightmost chair.\n\nIf Susan is in the rightmost chair, there are two remaining chairs for Tim and Zen to sit in. This can be arranged in 2 ways: Tim in the leftmost chair and Zen in the middle chair, or Zen in the leftmost chair and Tim in the middle chair.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 ways to arrange the group of 3 children.\n\nThe correct answer is not listed among the options provided."

Since C joined with Rs.120,000, the total capital after x months is Rs.100,000 + Rs.120,000 = Rs.220,000.\n\nSince the total profit at the end of the year is Rs.375,000 and C's share is Rs.150,000, the remaining profit for A and B is Rs.375,000 - Rs.150,000 = Rs.225,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the ratio of A and B's capital. A's capital is Rs.40,000 and B's capital is Rs.60,000. So, the ratio of their capital is 40,000:60,000 = 2:3.\n\nSince the remaining profit of Rs.225,000 is divided between A and B in the ratio of 2:3, we can calculate their shares as follows:\n\nA's share = (2/5) * Rs.225,000 = Rs.90,000\nB's share = (3/5) * Rs.225,000 = Rs.135,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the total capital after x months when C joined. Since C's share is Rs.150,000, the total capital after x months is Rs.150,000 + Rs.90,000 + Rs.135,000 = Rs.375,000.\n\nSince the total capital after x months is Rs.375,000, we can set up the equation:\n\nRs.375,000 = Rs.220,000 + Rs.150,000\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nRs.375,000 = Rs.370,000\n\nTherefore, x = 24 months.\n\nSo, C joined the business 24 months after B joined.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 24 months.",

If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family? (A)2 (B)3 (C)4 (D)5 (E)6\n\nAnswer: To find the number of members in the family, we need to determine the mode of the income distribution. Since the median income is $3000, we know that at least one member of the family earns $3000.\n\nLet's assume that there are two members in the family. In this case, the total income would be $6000, which is less than the given total income of $9000. Therefore, we can eliminate option (A)2.\n\nNow, let's assume that there are three members in the family. In this case, the total income would be $9000, which matches the given total income. Additionally, the median income would still be $3000. Therefore, option (B)3 is a possible answer.\n\nIf we assume that there are four or more members in the family, the total income would exceed $9000. Therefore, we can eliminate options (C)4, (D)5, and (E)6.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B)3."

(A)3267 (B)2678 (C)2797 (D)2300 (E)2781\n\nAnswer: To find the total number of votes the winning candidate received, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of eligible voters: 20% of 5,000 voters are not eligible to vote, so the number of eligible voters is 80% of 5,000.\n   Number of eligible voters = 0.8 * 5,000 = 4,000\n\n2. Calculate the total number of votes cast: Since there are two candidates, the total number of votes cast is equal to the number of eligible voters.\n   Total number of votes cast = 4,000\n\n3. Calculate the winning candidate's percentage of votes: The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, so the winning candidate's percentage of votes is 50% + 15% = 65%.\n\n4. Calculate the total number of votes the winning candidate received: Multiply the winning candidate's percentage of votes by the total number of votes cast.\n   Total number of votes the winning candidate received = 65% * 4,000 = 2,600\n\nTherefore, the total number of votes the winning candidate received is 2,600.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) 2,300."

Let's call the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts \"x\". \n\nSince the height of the shorter ant is 4 inches and its shadow is 10 inches long, we can write the proportion:\n\n4/10 = 6/x\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross multiply:\n\n4x = 10 * 6\n4x = 60\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we find:\n\nx = 60/4\nx = 15\n\nTherefore, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts is 15 inches. The answer is (D)15."

Therefore, the total length of paper required is:\n\nTotal length of paper = Cost of paper / Cost per meter = 260 / 2 = 130 meters\n\nNow, let's calculate the area of the walls.

Therefore, option (A) is not necessarily true.\n\n(B) y^2 > x^2: Since x is negative and y is positive, it is not necessarily true that y squared is greater than x squared. Therefore, option (B) is not necessarily true.\n\n(C) -x^3 < y^2: Since x is negative and y is positive, it is true that -x cubed is less than y squared. Therefore, option (C) must be true.\n\n(D) \u2013x < y: Since x is negative and y is positive, it is true that -x is less than y. Therefore, option (D) must be true.\n\n(E) x < \u2013y: Since x is negative and y is positive, it is not necessarily true that x is less than -y. Therefore, option (E) is not necessarily true.\n\nIn conclusion, options (C) and (D) must be true."

Let's call the number we're trying to find \"x\".\n\nAccording to the problem, the number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. This can be written as:\n\nx - 36 = 86 - x\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n2x = 86 + 36\n2x = 122\nx = 122/2\nx = 61\n\nTherefore, the number is 61. So the answer is (D)61."

(A)43 seconds (B)39 seconds (C)20 seconds (D)33 seconds (E)55 seconds\n\nAnswer: To find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel, we need to consider the length of the train as well.\n\nGiven:\n- The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which is 1 mile long.\n- The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the length of the train:\nSince the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, and the tunnel is 1 mile long, we can calculate the speed of the train in miles per second:\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = 1 mile / 3 seconds\nSpeed = 1/3 miles per second\n\nNow, let's calculate the length of the train:\nLength = Speed * Time\nLength = (1/3 miles per second) * 3 seconds\nLength = 1 mile\n\nSo, the length of the train is 1 mile.\n\nTo find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel, we need to consider the relative speed of the train and the tunnel.\n\nThe relative speed of the train and the tunnel is the difference between their speeds:\nRelative Speed = Train Speed - Tunnel Speed\nRelative Speed = 120 miles per hour - 1/3 miles per second\n\nNow, let's convert the relative speed to miles per second:\nRelative Speed = (120 miles per hour) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds)\nRelative Speed = 1/30 miles per second\n\nFinally, let's calculate the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel:\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\nTime = 1 mile / (1/30 miles per second)\nTime = 30 seconds\n\nTherefore, it will take 30 seconds for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) 20 seconds."

The formula to calculate time is distance divided by speed. So, the time taken to cover 15 km is 15 km / 10 km/h = 1.5 hours.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the time Shweta spends resting after each 15 km. She stops for 10 minutes, which is equal to 10/60 = 1/6 hours.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time for Shweta to cover 100 km. She will cover 15 km in 1.5 hours, rest for 1/6 hours, and repeat this process 6 times (since 100 km / 15 km = 6.67, but she will only rest 6 times).

(A)0.5 (B)1 (C)1.25 (D)1.5 (E)2\n\nAnswer: Let's assume that the initial volume of the soft drink is 1 gallon.\n\nIn 1 gallon of soft drink, there is 40% orange juice, which is 0.4 gallons of orange juice.\n\nTo make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to find out how much additional orange juice is needed.\n\nLet's assume the additional gallons of orange juice needed is x.\n\nThe total volume of the soft drink after adding x gallons of orange juice would be 1 + x gallons.\n\nThe volume of orange juice in the new mixture would be 0.4 + x gallons.\n\nAccording to the problem, the orange juice should be 60% of the soft drink, so we can set up the equation:\n\n(0.4 + x) / (1 + x) = 0.6\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\n0.4 - 0.6 = 0.6x - x\n\n-0.2 = 0.4x\n\nx = -0.2 / 0.4\n\nx = -0.5\n\nSince we cannot have a negative volume of orange juice, we can conclude that no additional gallons of orange juice are needed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 0.5."

The sum of the digits of N is: (A)10 (B)11 (C)12 (D)13 (E)14\n\nAnswer: To find the sum of the digits of N, we need to find a number that divides both 2272 and 875 with the same remainder.\n\nLet's start by finding the prime factorization of both numbers:\n2272 = 2^4 * 11 * 13\n875 = 5^3 * 7\n\nNow, let's consider the possible remainders when dividing by N. Since the remainder is the same for both numbers, it must be a common factor of their remainders.\n\nThe remainders for 2272 are 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\nThe remainders for 875 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\nThe common factors of these remainders are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nLet's try dividing both numbers by each of these common factors and see if we get the same remainder:\n\nFor N = 0:\n2272 \u00f7 0 = undefined\n875 \u00f7 0 = undefined\n\nFor N = 1:\n2272 \u00f7 1 = 2272\n875 \u00f7 1 = 875\n\nFor N = 2:\n2272 \u00f7 2 = 1136\n875 \u00f7 2 = 437.5 (not a whole number)\n\nFor N = 3:\n2272 \u00f7 3 = 757.33 (not a whole number)\n875 \u00f7 3 = 291.67 (not a whole number)\n\nFor N = 4:\n2272 \u00f7 4 = 568\n875 \u00f7 4 = 218.75 (not a whole number)\n\nFrom the above calculations, we can see that N = 1 is the only common factor that gives the same remainder when dividing both numbers.\n\nThe sum of the digits of N = 1 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 10."

If a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, then what is the total discount available at that retailer? (A)10% (B)25% (C)28% (D)30% (E)36%\n\nAnswer: To find the total discount available at the retailer, we need to calculate the combined discount of the manufacturer's discount and the additional discount offered by the retailer.\n\nThe manufacturer is offering a 20% discount on the price of the tubeless tyres. This means that the price after the manufacturer's discount is 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\n\nThe retailer is offering an additional 20% discount on the price after the manufacturer's discount. This means that the price after the retailer's discount is 80% - 20% = 60% of the original price.\n\nTherefore, the total discount available at the retailer is 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (E) 40%."

(A)71 (B)62 (C)43 (D)67 (E)40\n\nAnswer: Let's assume the weight of the new man is x kg.\n\nThe total weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement is 10 * average weight = 10 * (total weight / 10) = total weight.\n\nThe total weight of the 10 oarsmen after the replacement is (10 * average weight) + 1.8 kg = (10 * (total weight / 10)) + 1.8 kg = total weight + 1.8 kg.\n\nSince the average weight increased by 1.8 kg, we can set up the equation:\n\ntotal weight + 1.8 kg = (10 * (total weight / 10)) + 1.8 kg\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\ntotal weight + 1.8 kg = total weight + 1.8 kg\n\nThe total weight cancels out on both sides of the equation, leaving us with:\n\n1.8 kg = 1.8 kg\n\nThis equation is true for any value of x, so we cannot determine the weight of the new man based on the given information."

The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work? (A)4 (B)8 (C)22 (D)50 (E)20\n\nAnswer: First, let's find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself. We know that Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1 yacht per 12 hours.\n\nOn this particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. This means he completes 2/3 of the work in 12 hours. To find out how long it takes him to complete 1/3 of the work, we divide 12 hours by 2/3:\n\n12 hours \u00f7 2/3 = 12 hours \u00d7 3/2 = 18 hours\n\nSo, Jack takes 18 hours to complete 1/3 of the work.\n\nNow, let's find out how long it takes Jill to complete the remaining 1/3 of the work. We know that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. This means Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of 1 yacht per 12 hours, or 0.05 yachts per 12 hours.\n\nTo find out how long it takes Jill to complete 1/3 of the work, we divide 1/3 by Jill's rate of cleaning:\n\n(1/3) \u00f7 (0.05 yachts per 12 hours) = (1/3) \u00f7 (0.05/12) = (1/3) \u00d7 (12/0.05) = 4 \u00d7 12 = 48\n\nSo, it takes Jill 48 hours to complete the remaining 1/3 of the work.\n\nHowever, the question asks for how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, not just 1/3 of it. Since Jill is only doing the remaining 1/3 of the work, it will take her 48 hours \u00f7 1/3 = 48 hours \u00d7 3 = 144 hours to finish the remaining work.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided."

(A)AB/2700 (B)27/AB (C)AB/270 (D)2700/AB (E)100AB/27\n\nAnswer: To find the cost of B bottles in dollars, we can set up a proportion using the given information.\n\nWe know that 27 bottles cost A cents, so we can write the proportion:\n\n27 bottles / A cents = B bottles / X dollars\n\nTo solve for X, we can cross-multiply:\n\n27 * X = A * B\n\nDividing both sides by 27, we get:\n\nX = (A * B) / 27\n\nSince we want the cost in dollars, we need to convert cents to dollars by dividing by 100:\n\nX = (A * B) / (27 * 100)\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nX = AB / 2700\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) AB/2700."

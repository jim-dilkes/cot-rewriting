Joe finished above Dan.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that the order of the golfers is as follows:\n\nMel > Joe > Dan > Amy > Eve\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA) Mel finished second-to-last. - This statement is false because Mel finished first, not second-to-last.\n\nB) Dan finished second-to-last. - This statement is false because Dan finished third, not second-to-last.\n\nC) Amy finished second-to-last. - This statement is false because Amy finished fourth, not second-to-last.\n\nD) Joe finished second-to-last. - This statement is true because Joe finished second, making him second-to-last.\n\nE) Eve finished second-to-last. - This statement is false because Eve finished last, not second-to-last.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) Joe finished second-to-last."

Eve finished below Joe.\n2. Ana finished below Amy.\n3. Eve finished above Amy.\n4. Mya finished above Joe.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Joe finished ahead of Eve. From statement 4, we know that Mya finished ahead of Joe. Therefore, Mya finished ahead of Eve as well.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Ana finished ahead of Amy. From statement 3, we know that Eve finished ahead of Amy.

The blue book is the leftmost book.\n2. The red book is the third from the left.\n3. The white book is to the right of the gray book.\n4. The red book is to the left of the gray book.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that:\n\nA) The blue book is the second from the left. - False. The blue book is the leftmost book, not the second from the left.\nB) The red book is the second from the left. - False. The red book is the third from the left, not the second from the left.\nC) The purple book is the second from the left. - False. There is no information given about the position of the purple book.\nD) The gray book is the second from the left. - True. The gray book is to the right of the red book and to the left of the white book, making it the second from the left.\nE) The white book is the second from the left. - False. The white book is to the right of the gray book, making it the fourth from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) The gray book is the second from the left."

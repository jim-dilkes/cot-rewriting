Always face forward: This means you are initially facing a specific direction, but it doesn't affect your position.\n\n2. Take 4 steps backward: This means you move 4 steps in the opposite direction of your initial facing direction. Since you are facing forward, you move 4 steps backward.\n\n3. Take 4 steps left: This means you move 4 steps to the left from your current position. \n\nBased on the given instructions, you have moved 4 steps backward and 4 steps to the left. \n\nTo determine if you return to the starting point, we need to consider the net displacement. \n\nNet displacement = Total steps backward - Total steps forward + Total steps left - Total steps right\n\nIn this case, the total steps forward and right are both zero, so we can ignore them.\n\nNet displacement = Total steps backward - Total steps left\n\nSince you took 4 steps backward and 4 steps to the left, the net displacement is 4 - 4 = 0.\n\nTherefore, you return to the starting point.\n\nAnswer: Yes.\n",

This means you moved 6 units to the right from the starting point.\n\nThen, you turned around and took 7 steps to the left. This means you moved 7 units to the left from the position you were in after the first set of steps.\n\nFinally, you turned around again and took 4 steps backward. This means you moved 4 units backward from the position you were in after the second set of steps.\n\nTo determine if you have returned to the starting point, we need to calculate the net displacement. \n\nNet displacement = (6 units to the right) - (7 units to the left) - (4 units backward)\n\nNet displacement = -5 units\n\nSince the net displacement is not zero, it means you have not returned to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is no.\n",

If the total displacement is zero, then we have returned to the starting point.\n\nLet's calculate the total displacement:\n\n- 2 steps in the starting direction: +2\n- Turning around and taking 9 steps in the opposite direction: -9\n- Taking 7 steps in the same direction as step 2: +7\n- Taking 6 steps in the same direction as step 3: +6\n- Turning left: No change in direction\n- Taking 2 steps in the new direction: +2\n\nTotal displacement = +2 - 9 + 7 + 6 + 0 + 2 = +8\n\nSince the total displacement is not zero, we have not returned to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is no.\n",

Do you return to the starting point (yes/no)?\n### Goal ###\nThe goal of this problem is to determine whether following the given instructions will lead back to the starting point.### Steps ###\nTake 2 steps forward.\nTake 1 step backward.\nTake 3 steps left.\nTake 3 steps forward.\nTo determine if we have returned to the starting point, let's analyze the movements we have made so far:\n\n- We took 2 steps forward.\n- We took 1 step backward.\n- We took 3 steps left.\n- We took 3 steps forward.\n\nBy analyzing these movements, we can see that we have returned to the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the problem is yes, we have returned to the starting point.\n"

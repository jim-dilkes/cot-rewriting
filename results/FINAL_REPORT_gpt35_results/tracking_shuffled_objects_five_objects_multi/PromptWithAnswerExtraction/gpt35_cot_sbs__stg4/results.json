At the start of the match, they are each assigned to a position: Alice is playing right winger, Bob is playing right midfielder, Claire is playing left winger, Dave is playing cheerleader, and Eve is playing goalkeeper. \n\nAs the game progresses, pairs of players occasionally swap positions. First, Dave and Bob trade positions. Then, Dave and Eve trade positions. Then, Alice and Bob trade positions. Then, Dave and Claire trade positions. Finally, Dave and Eve trade positions. At the end of the match, Claire is playing \n\nA) right winger.\nB) right midfielder.\nC) left winger.\nD) cheerleader.\nE) goalkeeper.\n\nAnswer: Sure! Let's go step by step to determine Claire's position at the end of the match.\n\n1. At the start of the match, Claire is playing left winger.\n2. Then, Dave and Bob trade positions. This means Dave is now playing right midfielder and Bob is playing cheerleader.\n3. Next, Dave and Eve trade positions. This means Dave is now playing goalkeeper and Eve is playing right midfielder.\n4. Alice and Bob then trade positions. This means Alice is now playing cheerleader and Bob is playing right winger.\n5. Finally, Dave and Claire trade positions. This means Dave is now playing left winger and Claire is playing goalkeeper.\n\nSo, at the end of the match, Claire is playing goalkeeper.\n\nThe answer is E) goalkeeper."

At the end of the event, Claire has the \n\nA) purple present.\nB) brown present.\nC) black ball.\nD) red present.\nE) yellow present.\n\nAnswer: At the start of the event, Alice has a purple present, Bob has a brown present, Claire has a black ball, Dave has a red present, and Eve has a yellow present.\n\nFirst, Dave and Eve swap their gifts. After this swap, Alice still has the purple present, Bob still has the brown present, Claire still has the black ball, Dave now has the yellow present, and Eve now has the red present.\n\nNext, Eve and Claire swap their gifts. After this swap, Alice still has the purple present, Bob still has the brown present, Claire now has the red present, Dave still has the yellow present, and Eve now has the black ball.\n\nThen, Dave and Bob swap their gifts. After this swap, Alice still has the purple present, Bob now has the yellow present, Claire still has the red present, Dave now has the brown present, and Eve still has the black ball.\n\nNext, Claire and Bob swap their gifts. After this swap, Alice still has the purple present, Bob now has the red present, Claire now has the yellow present, Dave still has the brown present, and Eve still has the black ball.\n\nFinally, Dave and Alice swap their gifts. After this swap, Alice now has the brown present, Bob still has the red present, Claire now has the purple present, Dave still has the black ball, and Eve still has the yellow present.\n\nTherefore, at the end of the event, Claire has the purple present. So the answer is A) purple present."

This means Dave is still playing goalkeeper, Claire is still playing left winger, Alice is now playing cheerleader, and Eve is playing left midfielder. \n\nAfter the third swap, Claire and Alice trade positions. This means Dave is still playing goalkeeper, Claire is now playing cheerleader, Alice is playing left winger, and Eve is still playing left midfielder. \n\nAfter the fourth swap, Eve and Alice trade positions again. This means Dave is still playing goalkeeper, Claire is now playing left winger, Alice is now playing left midfielder, and Eve is still playing cheerleader. \n\nFinally, Eve and Bob trade positions.

At the start of the match, they are each assigned to a position: Alice is playing benchwarmer, Bob is playing fullback, Claire is playing left winger, Dave is playing right midfielder, and Eve is playing left midfielder. \n\nAs the game progresses, pairs of players occasionally swap positions. First, Dave and Alice trade positions. Then, Eve and Bob trade positions. Then, Claire and Dave trade positions. Then, Alice and Eve trade positions. Finally, Alice and Bob trade positions. At the end of the match, Eve is playing \n\nA) benchwarmer.\nB) fullback.\nC) left winger.\nD) right midfielder.\nE) left midfielder.\n\nAnswer: Sure! Let's go step by step to determine where Eve is playing at the end of the match.\n\n1. At the start of the match, Eve is playing left midfielder.\n\n2. Dave and Alice trade positions. This means Eve remains in her position as left midfielder, while Alice becomes the right midfielder.\n\n3. Eve and Bob trade positions. Now, Eve becomes the fullback, while Bob takes over as the left midfielder.\n\n4. Claire and Dave trade positions. Since Eve is now the fullback, this swap does not involve her. Claire becomes the right midfielder, and Dave takes over as the left winger.\n\n5. Alice and Eve trade positions. Now, Eve becomes the right midfielder, while Alice takes over as the fullback.\n\n6. Alice and Bob trade positions. Finally, Eve becomes the left midfielder, and Bob becomes the fullback.\n\nSo, at the end of the match, Eve is playing as the left midfielder.\n\nTherefore, the answer is E) left midfielder."

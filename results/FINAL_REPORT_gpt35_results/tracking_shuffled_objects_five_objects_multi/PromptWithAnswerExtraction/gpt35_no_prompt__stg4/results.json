At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Jamie, Bob is dancing with Patrick, Claire is dancing with Ophelia, Dave is dancing with Melissa, and Eve is dancing with Rodrigo. \n\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Dave and Bob switch partners. Then, Claire and Dave switch partners. Then, Eve and Alice switch partners. Then, Claire and Eve switch partners. Finally, Alice and Eve switch partners. At the end of the dance, Eve is dancing with  \n\nA) Jamie.\nB) Patrick.\nC) Ophelia.\nD) Melissa.\nE) Rodrigo.\n\nAnswer: At the end of the dance, Eve is dancing with Patrick. \n\nLet's go through the partner switches step by step:\n\n1. Dave and Bob switch partners:\n   - Alice is still dancing with Jamie.\n   - Bob is now dancing with Melissa.\n   - Claire is still dancing with Ophelia.\n   - Dave is now dancing with Patrick.\n   - Eve is still dancing with Rodrigo.\n\n2. Claire and Dave switch partners:\n   - Alice is still dancing with Jamie.\n   - Bob is now dancing with Melissa.\n   - Claire is now dancing with Patrick.\n   - Dave is now dancing with Ophelia.\n   - Eve is still dancing with Rodrigo.\n\n3. Eve and Alice switch partners:\n   - Alice is now dancing with Rodrigo.\n   - Bob is still dancing with Melissa.\n   - Claire is now dancing with Patrick.\n   - Dave is now dancing with Ophelia.\n   - Eve is now dancing with Jamie.\n\n4. Claire and Eve switch partners:\n   - Alice is now dancing with Rodrigo.\n   - Bob is still dancing with Melissa.\n   - Claire is now dancing with Jamie.\n   - Dave is now dancing with Ophelia.\n   - Eve is now dancing with Patrick.\n\n5. Alice and Eve switch partners:\n   - Alice is now dancing with Patrick.\n   - Bob is still dancing with Melissa.\n   - Claire is now dancing with Jamie.\n   - Dave is now dancing with Ophelia.\n   - Eve is now dancing with Rodrigo.\n\nTherefore, at the end of the dance, Eve is dancing with Patrick. So the answer is B) Patrick."

At the end of the game, Alice has the \n\nA) black ball.\nB) purple ball.\nC) green ball.\nD) brown ball.\nE) white ball.\n\nAnswer: At the end of the game, Alice has the green ball. \n\nTo determine this, let's track the ball swaps:\n\n1. Eve and Bob swap balls: Alice has the black ball, Bob has the white ball, Claire has the green ball, Dave has the brown ball, and Eve has the purple ball.\n2. Dave and Claire swap balls: Alice has the black ball, Bob has the white ball, Claire has the brown ball, Dave has the green ball, and Eve has the purple ball.\n3. Dave and Alice swap balls: Alice has the green ball, Bob has the white ball, Claire has the brown ball, Dave has the black ball, and Eve has the purple ball.\n4. Dave and Claire swap balls: Alice has the green ball, Bob has the white ball, Claire has the black ball, Dave has the brown ball, and Eve has the purple ball.\n5. Alice and Claire swap balls: Alice has the green ball, Bob has the white ball, Claire has the green ball, Dave has the brown ball, and Eve has the purple ball.\n\nTherefore, Alice has the green ball at the end of the game. The answer is C) green ball."

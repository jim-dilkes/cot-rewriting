Therefore, the eighth composition performed must be either L or H. \n\nNow, let's consider the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. If T is performed immediately before F, then the compositions performed after T and before F must be H, L, O, P, and R. However, this violates the condition that exactly two compositions are performed after F but before O. Therefore, T cannot be performed immediately before F.\n\nIf T is not performed immediately before F, then it must be performed immediately after R. Therefore, R must be performed sixth.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Since R is performed sixth, there must be at least two compositions performed after F and before R. Therefore, F must be performed second.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that exactly two compositions are performed after F but before O. Since F is performed second, there must be exactly two compositions performed after F but before O. Therefore, H must be performed third and L must be performed fourth.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that exactly two compositions are performed after F but before O. Since H is performed third and L is performed fourth, there are exactly two compositions performed after F but before O. Therefore, P must be performed fifth and T must be performed eighth.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Since O is performed seventh and T is performed eighth, there must be at least one composition performed after O and before S. Therefore, S must be performed ninth.\n\nFinally, let's consider the condition that P is performed at some time before S. Since P is performed fifth and S is performed ninth, P must be performed before S. Therefore, the order of performance is:\n\n1. O\n2. F\n3. H\n4. L\n5. P\n6. R\n7. O\n8. T\n9. S\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) seventh.",

The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\n\nIf exactly two compositions are performed after F but before O, then R must be performed\n\n(A)first\n(B)third\n(C)fourth\n(D)sixth\n(E)seventh\n\nSolution: To solve this problem, we will use a process of elimination.\n\nFirst, let's consider the condition that O is performed either first or fifth. If O is performed first, then the compositions performed after O and before S must be F, H, L, P, and R. However, this violates the condition that exactly two compositions are performed after F but before O. Therefore, O cannot be performed first.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that P is performed at some time before S. If P is performed before S, then the compositions performed after P and before S must be F, H, L, O, and R. However, this violates the condition that exactly two compositions are performed after F but before O. Therefore, P cannot be performed before S.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. If O is performed fifth, then the compositions performed after O and before S must be F, H, L, P, and R. However, this violates the condition that exactly two compositions are performed after F but before O. Therefore, O cannot be performed fifth.\n\nSince O cannot be performed first or fifth, it must be performed seventh. Therefore, the eighth composition performed must be either L or H. \n\nNow, let's consider the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. If T is performed immediately before F, then the compositions performed after T and before F must be H, L, O, P, and R. However, this violates the condition that exactly two compositions are performed after F but before O. Therefore, T cannot be performed immediately before F.\n\nIf T is not performed immediately before F, then it must be performed immediately after R. Therefore, R must be performed sixth.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Since R is performed sixth, there must be at least two compositions performed after F and before R. Therefore, F must be performed second.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that exactly two compositions are performed after F but before O. Since F is performed second, there must be exactly two compositions performed after F but before O. Therefore, H must be performed third and L must be performed fourth.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that exactly two compositions are performed after F but before O. Since H is performed third and L is performed fourth, there are exactly two compositions performed after F but before O. Therefore, P must be performed fifth and T must be performed eighth.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Since O is performed seventh and T is performed eighth, there must be at least one composition performed after O and before S. Therefore, S must be performed ninth.\n\nFinally, let's consider the condition that P is performed at some time before S. Since P is performed fifth and S is performed ninth, P must be performed before S. Therefore, the order of performance is:\n\n1. O\n2. F\n3. H\n4. L\n5. P\n6. R\n7. O\n8. T\n9.

Therefore, Himalayans cannot be featured on day 2.\n\nSince no breed can be featured on day 2, we can eliminate options (A), (B), and (C) because they all involve a breed being featured on day 2.\n\nNow let's analyze option (D): Himalayans are featured on day 6. This option is possible because it does not violate any of the given conditions.\n\nFinally, let's analyze option (E): Greyhounds are featured on day 7. This option is not possible because condition 3 states that any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, and Greyhounds are featured on day 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Himalayans are featured on day 6."

Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo\u2014fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\n\nIf there is exactly one bay between the bay holding machinery and the bay holding grain, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?\n\n(A)two\n(B)three\n(C)four\n(D)five\n(E)six\n\nSolution: To solve this problem, we can use the given information to create a diagram representing the different bays and their corresponding cargo types. \n\nBased on the given information, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.\n2. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.\n3. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.\n4.

Therefore, we can fill in the diagram as follows:\n\nBay 1: \nBay 2: \nBay 3: \nBay 4: \nBay 5: produce\nBay 6: textiles\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"there is exactly one bay between the bay holding machinery and the bay holding grain.\" This means that machinery and grain cannot be in bays that are next to each other. Since there are only six bays, this statement implies that machinery and grain must be in bays 1 and 4, in some order. \n\nLet's consider the two possibilities:\n\nPossibility 1: Machinery is in bay 1 and grain is in bay 4.\nBay 1: machinery\nBay 2: \nBay 3: \nBay 4: grain\nBay 5: produce\nBay 6: textiles\n\nIn this case, we can see that the type of cargo for bays 2 and 3 is not completely determined.\n\nPossibility 2: Machinery is in bay 4 and grain is in bay 1.\nBay 1: grain\nBay 2: \nBay 3: \nBay 4: machinery\nBay 5: produce\nBay 6: textiles\n\nIn this case, we can see that the type of cargo for bays 2 and 3 is also not completely determined.\n\nTherefore, in neither possibility is the type of cargo completely determined for any of the six bays. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) six."

The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.

Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\nThis means that Megregian must review more plays than both Kramer and Lopez.\n\n2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\nThis means that Jiang cannot review Tamerlane, since both Lopez and Megregian do not review any play that Jiang reviews.\n\n3.

Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, Megregian reviews more plays than both of them, and there are two students who review the same play.\n\n(C) Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\nThis option does not satisfy condition 4, as there are three students who review Tamerlane.\n\n(D) Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\nThis option satisfies all the conditions. Kramer, Megregian, and O'Neill all review Tamerlane, Megregian reviews more plays than both Kramer and Lopez, and there are two students who review the same play.\n\n(E) Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\nThis option does not satisfy condition 3, as Kramer does not review Tamerlane.\n\nBased on the analysis, the options that could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane are (B) Kramer, O'Neill and (D) Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill."

The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\n\nWhich one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne, would have the same effect in determining the assignment of the ambassadors?\n\n(A)If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo.\n(B)If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke.\n(C)If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.\n(D)Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.\n(E)Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.\n\nSolution: The original constraint states that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. This means that if Jaramillo is chosen for an ambassadorship, Kayne must also be chosen.\n\nTo have the same effect, we need a statement that states if Kayne is chosen for an ambassadorship, then Jaramillo must also be chosen.\n\nThe only option that satisfies this condition is (A) If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo."

Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\n\nIf Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)Reynaldo tests G on the second day.\n(B)Seamus tests H on the first day.\n(C)Yuki tests H on the second day.\n(D)Seamus is one of the testers for J.\n(E)Theresa is one of the testers for G.\n\nSolution: Let's analyze the given conditions:\n\n1. Reynaldo cannot test F.\n2. Yuki cannot test J.\n3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.\n4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where Theresa tests J on the first day.\n\nIf Theresa tests J on the first day, then we know that Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki must test either F, G, or H on the first day. Since Theresa must be one of the testers for H, Yuki cannot test H on the first day. Therefore, Yuki must test either F or G on the first day.\n\nAccording to condition 4, the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. So, if Yuki tests F on the first day, Seamus must test F on the second day. This means Seamus cannot test J on the second day, so option (D) is not true.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining options:\n\n(A) Reynaldo tests G on the second day: This is possible because Reynaldo can test any bicycle except F.\n\n(B) Seamus tests H on the first day: This is possible because Seamus can test any bicycle on the first day.\n\n(C) Yuki tests H on the second day: This is possible because Yuki can test any bicycle except J.\n\n(E) Theresa is one of the testers for G: This is possible because Theresa can test any bicycle except J.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Reynaldo tests G on the second day."

The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n\nWhich one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses?\n\n(A)A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.\n(B)A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\n(C)Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.\n(D)No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.\n(E)The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.\n\nSolution: The correct answer is (D) No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.\n\nThis constraint ensures that the two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses.

However, this contradicts condition 4, which states that the pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. Therefore, option (A) is not true.\n\n(B) Wayne performs the third solo.\nIf Wayne performs the third solo, then the second solo must be a modern piece performed by Zara. However, this contradicts condition 4, which states that the pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. Therefore, option (B) is not true.\n\n(C) Zara performs the fifth solo.\nIf Zara performs the fifth solo, then the second solo must be a modern piece performed by Wayne. However, this contradicts condition 4, which states that the pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. Therefore, option (C) is not true.\n\n(D) The second solo is a traditional piece.\nIf the second solo is a traditional piece, then Wayne must perform it. This means Zara cannot perform the first solo, as she would then have to perform the second solo. Therefore, Wayne must perform the first solo. This also means that Zara cannot perform the third solo, as she would then have to perform the second solo. Therefore, Wayne must perform the third solo. The fourth solo can be either a traditional piece performed by Wayne or a modern piece performed by Zara. The fifth solo must be a modern piece performed by Zara. Therefore, option (D) is true.\n\n(E) The fourth solo is a modern piece.\nIf the fourth solo is a modern piece, then Zara must perform it. This means Wayne cannot perform the first solo, as he would then have to perform the second solo. Therefore, Zara must perform the first solo. This also means that Wayne cannot perform the third solo, as he would then have to perform the second solo. Therefore, Zara must perform the third solo. The second solo can be either a traditional piece performed by Wayne or a modern piece performed by Zara. The fifth solo must be a traditional piece performed by Wayne. Therefore, option (E) is not true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (D) The second solo is a traditional piece."

L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\n\nIf P is shown in the afternoon, which one of the following must be true?\n\n(A)J is shown seventh.\n(B)K is shown third.\n(C)N is shown first.\n(D)M is shown in the afternoon.\n(E)O is shown in the morning.\n\nSolution: Based on the given information, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. J must be shown in the evening.\n2. K cannot be shown in the morning.\n3. L must be shown after K and before M.\n\nIf P is shown in the afternoon, it means that P cannot be shown in the morning or evening. Therefore, P must be shown as the third house.\n\nSince L must be shown after K, and P is shown as the third house, it means that K cannot be shown as the third house. Therefore, K must be shown as the second house.\n\nNow, we have the following order for the morning: _ K _.\n\nSince J must be shown in the evening, it means that J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon. Therefore, J must be shown as the seventh house.\n\nNow, we have the following order for the evening: _ _ _ _ _ _ J.\n\nSince L must be shown after K and before M, and K is shown as the second house, it means that L must be shown as the fourth house.\n\nNow, we have the following order for the afternoon: _ _ L _ _ P _.\n\nSince N is the only house left, it must be shown as the first house.\n\nNow, we have the following order for the morning: N K _.\n\nSince M is the only house left, it must be shown as the fifth house.\n\nNow, we have the following order for the afternoon: N K L M _ P _.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) M is shown in the afternoon."

Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\n\nIf Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\n\n(A)Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n(B)Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n(C)Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n(D)Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n(E)Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n\nSolution: Let's analyze the given conditions:\n\n1. Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.\n2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.\n3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.\n4. Hong does not testify on Monday.\n5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\n\nFrom condition 1, we know that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. Therefore, Franco cannot testify on Monday.\n\nFrom condition 2, we know that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.\n\nFrom condition 3, we know that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Since Iturbe is testifying on Wednesday, he cannot testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Iturbe cannot be one of the two witnesses testifying on Tuesday.\n\nFrom condition 4, we know that Hong does not testify on Monday.\n\nFrom condition 5, we know that at least one witness testifies on Monday.\n\nBased on the given conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Franco cannot testify on Monday.\n- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.\n- Hong does not testify on Monday.\n- At least one witness testifies on Monday.\n\nFrom these deductions, we can conclude that Franco must testify on Tuesday. This means that Hong cannot testify on Tuesday, as Franco and Hong cannot testify on the same day.\n\nTherefore, the only option that must be true of the schedule is (D) Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday."

Three of the articles\u2014G, H, and J\u2014cover finance; three other articles\u2014Q, R, and S\u2014cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\n\nThe order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?\n\n(A)H is fourth.\n(B)H is sixth.\n(C)R is fourth.\n(D)R is seventh.\n(E)Y is fifth.\n\nSolution: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and determine the order in which the articles can be edited.\n\n1. Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.\n2. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.\n3. S must be earlier than Y.\n4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\n\nLet's analyze each answer choice:\n\n(A) H is fourth.\nIf H is fourth, then the first three articles cannot be finance articles (G, H, J). However, since there are only three finance articles, this condition cannot be satisfied. Therefore, this option is not true.\n\n(B) H is sixth.\nIf H is sixth, then the first five articles cannot be finance articles (G, H, J). However, since there are only three finance articles, this condition cannot be satisfied. Therefore, this option is not true.\n\n(C) R is fourth.\nIf R is fourth, then the first three articles cannot be finance articles (G, H, J). However, since there are only three finance articles, this condition cannot be satisfied. Therefore, this option is not true.\n\n(D) R is seventh.\nIf R is seventh, then the first six articles cannot be finance articles (G, H, J). However, since there are only three finance articles, this condition cannot be satisfied. Therefore, this option is not true.\n\n(E) Y is fifth.\nIf Y is fifth, then the first four articles cannot be wildlife articles (Y). This means that the first four articles must be finance (G, H, J) or nutrition (Q, R, S) articles. Since S must be earlier than Y, S cannot be the fourth article. Therefore, the first four articles must be finance articles (G, H, J). The remaining three articles must be nutrition articles (Q, R, S). Since G must be earlier than R, the order of the articles is determined as follows:\n\n1. G (finance)\n2. H (finance)\n3. J (finance)\n4. Q (nutrition)\n5. S (nutrition)\n6. R (nutrition)\n7. Y (wildlife)\n\nTherefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if Y is fifth. The correct answer is (E)."

Therefore, the western must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.

The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.\n\nIf Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, which one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)The lithographs lecture is third.\n(B)The oil paintings lecture is third.\n(C)The sculptures lecture is first.\n(D)The sculptures lecture is second.\n(E)The watercolors lecture is second.\n\nSolution: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.\n2. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.\n3. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) The lithographs lecture is third.\nIf the lithographs lecture is third, then the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. However, this contradicts the fact that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, option (A) is not possible.\n\n(B) The oil paintings lecture is third.\nIf the oil paintings lecture is third, then the lithographs lecture must be later than the oil paintings lecture. However, this contradicts the fact that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, option (B) is not possible.\n\n(C) The sculptures lecture is first.\nIf the sculptures lecture is first, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. This is possible since Farley's lecture can be on watercolors or lithographs. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, which is also possible since Holden's lecture can be on oil paintings or watercolors. Therefore, option (C) is possible.\n\n(D) The sculptures lecture is second.\nIf the sculptures lecture is second, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. This is possible since Farley's lecture can be on watercolors or lithographs. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, which is also possible since Holden's lecture can be on oil paintings or watercolors. Therefore, option (D) is possible.\n\n(E) The watercolors lecture is second.\nIf the watercolors lecture is second, then the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture. However, this contradicts the fact that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, option (E) is not possible.\n\nBased on the analysis, the possible option is (C) The sculptures lecture is first."

Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.\n\nWhich one of the following must be true?\n\n(A)There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.\n(B)There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.\n(C)Peach is used in one of the rugs.\n(D)Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.\n(E)Yellow is used in one of the rugs.\n\nSolution: To solve this problem, we can go through each statement and determine if it is true or false based on the given rules.\n\n(A) There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.\nThis statement is false. There is no rule that prohibits forest from being used in a multicolored rug.\n\n(B) There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.\nThis statement is false. There is no rule that prohibits turquoise from being used in a multicolored rug.\n\n(C) Peach is used in one of the rugs.\nThis statement is true. According to the rule, if olive is used, peach must also be used. Since olive is one of the available colors, peach must be used in one of the rugs.\n\n(D) Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.\nThis statement is true. According to the rule, turquoise cannot be used with peach. Since peach is used in one of the rugs, turquoise must be used in one of the other rugs.\n\n(E) Yellow is used in one of the rugs.\nThis statement is true. There is no rule that prohibits yellow from being used in any of the rugs.\n\nBased on our analysis, the statements that must be true are (C) Peach is used in one of the rugs, (D) Turquoise is used in one of the rugs, and (E) Yellow is used in one of the rugs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Peach is used in one of the rugs."

If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. However, Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, as there is no year before 1923. Therefore, this possibility is not valid.\n\n2. If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. This means that Ryan cannot be assigned to any other year. Therefore, this possibility is not valid.\n\n3. If Mollie is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. This means that Ryan cannot be assigned to any other year. Therefore, this possibility is not valid.\n\n4. If Yoshio is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. This means that Ryan cannot be assigned to any other year. Therefore, this possibility is not valid.\n\nSince none of the possibilities allow for a valid assignment to 1923, we can conclude that no student can be assigned to 1923.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining years for assignment are 1921, 1922, and 1924. Since there are six students available and only three years remaining, each year can have two students assigned to it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) two.",

Therefore, this possibility is not valid.\n\n3. If Mollie is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. This means that Ryan cannot be assigned to any other year. Therefore, this possibility is not valid.\n\n4. If Yoshio is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. This means that Ryan cannot be assigned to any other year.

                            "content": "Problem Statement: A chorus director is planning to audition exactly six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.\n\nWhich one of the following, if substituted for the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, would have the same effect in determining the order of the auditions?\n\n(A)Zinn's audition is the only one that can take place earlier than Waite's.\n(B)Waite's audition must take place either immediately before or immediately after Zinn's.\n(C)Waite's audition must take place earlier than Lugo's.\n(D)Waite's audition must be either first or second.\n(E)The first audition cannot be recorded.\n\nSolution: The given conditions are as follows:\n1. The fourth audition cannot be recorded.\n2. The fifth audition must be recorded.\n3. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.\n4. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.\n5. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.\n\nTo determine the order of the auditions, we can start by using condition 5. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. This means that Zinn's audition cannot be the last one. Therefore, Yoshida's audition must be the last one.\n\nNow, let's consider condition 4. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Since Yoshida's audition is the last one, Kammer's audition cannot be the last one. Therefore, Trillo's audition must be the last one before Yoshida's.\n\nNow, let's consider condition 3. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Since Trillo's audition is the last one before Yoshida's, Waite's audition cannot be the last one. Therefore, Waite's audition must be the fifth one, which is recorded.\n\nNow, let's consider condition 2. The fifth audition must be recorded. We have already determined that Waite's audition is the fifth one, so this condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's consider condition 1. The fourth audition cannot be recorded. Since Waite's audition is the fifth one, the fourth audition cannot be Waite's audition. Therefore, the fourth audition must be one of the other four singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, or Zinn.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining conditions. We have determined that the order of the auditions is as follows:\n1. [Empty]\n2. [Empty]\n3. [Empty]\n4. [Empty]\n5. Waite (recorded)\n6. Yoshida (recorded)\n\nNow, let's consider the given options to find a substitution for the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.\n\n(A) Zinn's audition is the only one that can take place earlier than Waite's.\nThis option does not have the same effect because it only specifies Zinn's audition, not the two recorded auditions.\n\n(B) Waite's audition must take place either immediately before or immediately after Zinn's.\nThis option does not have the same effect because it only specifies Zinn's audition, not the two recorded auditions.\n\n(C) Waite's audition must take place earlier than Lugo's.\nThis option does not have the same effect because it specifies Lugo's audition, not the two recorded auditions.\n\n(D) Waite's audition must be either first or second.\nThis option has the same effect because it specifies that Waite's audition must be one of the first two auditions. In our determined order, Waite's audition is the fifth one, which is not one of the first two auditions.\n\n(E) The first audition cannot be recorded.\nThis option does not have the same effect because it specifies the first audition, not the two recorded auditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct substitution for the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions is (D) Waite's audition must be either first or second."

Since W is mentioned in either chapter 3 or chapter 4, T must be mentioned in either chapter 1 or chapter 2.\n4. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Since U is mentioned in chapter 2, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, S must be mentioned in either chapter 4, 5, 6, or 7. Since Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters with S, Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, 4, 5, or 6. Therefore, Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.\n5. R is the only clue left. Since R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and T must be mentioned in either chapter 1 or chapter 2, R must be mentioned in either chapter 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\nBased on these deductions, the only option that could be true is (B) R is mentioned in chapter 7."

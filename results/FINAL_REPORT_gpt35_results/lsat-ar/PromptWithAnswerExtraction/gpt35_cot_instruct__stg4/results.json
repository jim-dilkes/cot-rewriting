If Nina's report is on Wednesday, then the morning reports can be any combination of the remaining 3 students: Helen, Irving, and Olivia.\n\nStep 5: Determine the possible combinations for the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:\n- Monday: Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert\n- Tuesday: Helen, Irving, Nina, and Olivia\n- Wednesday: Helen, Irving, and Olivia\n\nStep 6: Match the possible combinations with the answer choices:\n- (A) Helen, George, and Nina: George cannot give a report on Monday, so this combination is not possible.\n- (B) Irving, Robert, and Helen: This combination matches the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n- (C) Nina, Helen, and Olivia: This combination does not match the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n- (D) Olivia, Robert, and Irving: This combination does not match the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n- (E) Robert, George, and Helen: George cannot give a report on Monday, so this combination is not possible.\n\nStep 7: Conclusion:\nThe morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday could be given by Irving, Robert, and Helen. Therefore, the answer is (B).",

This means that if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.\n\n| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| Monday      |               |        |\n| Tuesday      | George      |        |\n| Wednesday |               |        |\n\nStep 4: Consider the remaining students and their possible combinations:\n- We have 6 students remaining: Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, and Olivia.\n- We need to fill in the remaining slots on Monday and Wednesday.\n\n| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| Monday      |               |        |\n| Tuesday      | George      |        |\n| Wednesday |               |        |\n\nStep 5: Consider the condition that if Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n- If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.\n- If Nina does not give a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving can give reports on Monday.\n\n| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| Monday      | Helen      |        |\n| Tuesday      | George      |        |\n| Wednesday |               |        |\n\nStep 6: Consider the remaining students and their possible combinations:\n- We have 4 students remaining: Irving, Kyle, Lenore, and Olivia.\n- We need to fill in the remaining slots on Wednesday.\n\n| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| Monday      | Helen      |        |\n| Tuesday      | George      |        |\n| Wednesday |               |        |\n\nStep 7: Consider the condition that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.\n- Since Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, we can eliminate her from the remaining slots on Wednesday.\n\n| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| Monday      | Helen      |        |\n| Tuesday      | George      |        |\n| Wednesday |               |        |\n\nStep 8: Consider the remaining students and their possible combinations:\n- We have 3 students remaining: Irving, Kyle, and Lenore.\n- We need to fill in the remaining slots on Wednesday.\n\n| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| Monday      | Helen      |        |\n| Tuesday      | George      |        |\n| Wednesday |               |        |\n\nStep 9: Consider the condition that if Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n- Since Nina did not give a report on Tuesday, Helen and Irving can give reports on Wednesday.\n\n| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| Monday      | Helen      |        |\n| Tuesday      | George      |        |\n| Wednesday | Irving      | Helen       |\n\nStep 10: Determine the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday.\n- From the chart, we can see that the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday is Irving and Helen.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Irving and Helen."

The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\n\nIf S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?\n\n(A)F, H, P\n(B)H, P. L\n(C)O, P, R\n(D)O, P, T\n(E)P, R, T\n\nSolution: Step 1: Identify the given information and conditions:\n- There are eight compositions: F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T.\n- T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.\n- At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.\n- O is performed either first or fifth.\n- The eighth composition performed is either L or H.\n- P is performed at some time before S.\n- At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\n- S is performed fourth.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given conditions:\n- Since S is performed fourth, we can deduce that the order of performances is: _ _ S _ _ _ _ _.\n- T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. This means that either T is performed third and F is performed fourth, or R is performed fourth and T is performed fifth.\n- At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. This means that either F is performed first and R is performed fourth, or R is performed first and F is performed fourth.\n- O is performed either first or fifth. Since S is performed fourth, O cannot be performed fifth. Therefore, O must be performed first.\n- The eighth composition performed is either L or H. This means that either L is performed eighth or H is performed eighth.\n- P is performed at some time before S. Since S is performed fourth, P must be performed either first, second, or third.\n\nStep 3: Combine the deductions:\n- Based on the deductions from Step 2, we have the following possibilities for the order of performances: O _ _ S _ _ _ _ and O _ _ _ S _ _ _.\n- Since P is performed before S, we can eliminate the second possibility (O _ _ _ S _ _ _).\n- Since O is performed first, the remaining possibility is O _ _ S _ _ _ _.\n- Since T is performed either third or fifth, and F is performed either first or fourth, we can deduce that the order of performances is: O _ T S _ _ _ _ or O _ _ S F _ _ _.\n\nStep 4: Test the remaining possibilities:\n- In the first possibility (O _ T S _ _ _ _), we need to place F, H, L, and R in the remaining positions. However, we cannot satisfy the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Therefore, this possibility is not valid.\n- In the second possibility (O _ _ S F _ _ _), we need to place H, L, R, and T in the remaining positions. We can satisfy the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F by placing H, L, and R in the remaining positions. Therefore, this possibility is valid.\n\nStep 5: Determine the accurate list of compositions performed first, second, and third:\n- Based on the valid possibility (O _ _ S F _ _ _), the accurate list of compositions performed first, second, and third is: O, P, R.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) O, P, R."

Each bay holds a different type of cargo - fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. We are given several clues about the arrangement of the bays and their cargos. We need to determine how many bays have their cargo completely determined.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the clues\nLet's analyze the given clues one by one:\n1. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.\n2. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.\n3. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.\n4. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\n5. There is exactly one bay between the bay holding machinery and the bay holding grain.\n\nStep 3: Create a diagram\nTo visualize the arrangement of the bays and their cargos, let's create a diagram.

True, Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n- (D) Xu is assigned parking space #6. False, Xu can be assigned parking space #3, #4, #5, or #6.\n- (E) Young is assigned parking space #2. False, Young is assigned parking space #4.\n\nStep 10: Conclusion:\n- Based on the given information and the determined parking space assignments, the correct answer is (B) Togowa is assigned parking space #2."

However, it does not provide any information about Landon or Ong's assignments.\n\n(B) Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia: This option is possible, as it satisfies the constraint that if Landon is assigned, it must be to Zambia.

Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, Tiao works in Zone 2, and the remaining four sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall) work in Zone 3.\n  2. Tiao and Quinn work in Zone 1, Parra works in Zone 2, and the remaining four sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall) work in Zone 3.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question:\n- The question asks which one of the following could be true if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.\n- In scenario 1, Tiao works in Zone 2, which means that option (D) Tiao works in Zone 1 could be true.\n- In scenario 2, Parra works in Zone 2, which means that option (C) Parra works in Zone 3 could be true.\n- Therefore, the answer is (C) Parra works in Zone 3."

No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?\n\n(A)zero\n(B)one\n(C)two\n(D)three\n(E)four\n\nSolution: Step 1: Identify the given information and conditions:\n- There are five solos in total.\n- The third solo is a traditional piece.\n- Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively.\n- In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece.\n- The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo.\n- No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.\n\nStep 2: Determine the possible scenarios based on the given conditions:\n- Since the third solo is a traditional piece, there are two consecutive traditional pieces. This means that the second and fourth solos must be traditional pieces.\n- In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. This means that Wayne cannot perform the fourth solo if it is a modern piece.\n- The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. This means that Wayne cannot perform the second solo if he performs the fourth solo.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the scenarios to determine the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece:\nScenario 1: Wayne performs the first solo (modern), Zara performs the second and third solos (both traditional), Wayne performs the fourth solo (traditional), and Zara performs the fifth solo (modern).\nIn this scenario, Wayne performs a traditional piece in only one solo (the fourth solo). Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is one.\n\nScenario 2: Wayne performs the first solo (modern), Zara performs the second and third solos (both traditional), Zara performs the fourth solo (modern), and Wayne performs the fifth solo (traditional).\nIn this scenario, Wayne performs a traditional piece in two solos (the third and fifth solos). Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is two.\n\nStep 4: Compare the scenarios to determine the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece:\nBased on the analysis, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is one (Scenario 1).\n\nStep 5: Choose the correct answer:\nThe minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is one. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) one."

No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\n\nIf in the fifth solo Wayne performs a traditional piece, which one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)Zara performs the first solo.\n(B)Wayne performs the second solo.\n(C)Zara performs the third solo.\n(D)The second solo is a modem piece.\n(E)The fourth solo is a traditional piece.\n\nSolution: Step 1: Understand the given conditions and constraints.\n- There are two pianists, Wayne and Zara.\n- There will be five solos performed one after another.\n- Each solo can be either a modern piece or a traditional piece.\n- The third solo is a traditional piece.\n- Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively.\n- In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece.\n- The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo.\n- No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.\n- In the fifth solo, Wayne performs a traditional piece.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given options.\n(A) Zara performs the first solo.\n(B) Wayne performs the second solo.\n(C) Zara performs the third solo.\n(D) The second solo is a modern piece.\n(E) The fourth solo is a traditional piece.\n\nStep 3: Apply the given conditions and constraints to eliminate options.\n- The third solo is a traditional piece. This eliminates options (A) and (B) since Zara cannot perform the first solo and Wayne cannot perform the second solo.\n- Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. This means that the third solo must be a traditional piece and the fourth solo must also be a traditional piece. This eliminates option (D) since the second solo cannot be a modern piece.\n- In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. Since the fourth solo is a traditional piece (as determined in the previous step), Wayne must perform it. This eliminates option (C) since Zara cannot perform the third solo.\n- No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. Since Wayne performs a traditional piece in the fifth solo, this means that Wayne must have performed at least one modern piece before the fifth solo. Therefore, option (E) is possible.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nBased on the given conditions and constraints, the only option that could be true is (E) - the fourth solo is a traditional piece."

None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.\n2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.\n3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\n\nStep 3: Determine the possible combinations\nBased on the given conditions, let's determine the possible combinations for the service targets:\n\n- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. This means Image's voicemail target cannot be 3 days.\n- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. This means Image's website target cannot be longer than its voicemail target.\n- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. This means Solide's website target cannot be 3 days.\n\nBased on these conditions, the possible combinations for the service targets are as follows:\n\nImage:\n- Website target: 1 day or 2 days\n- Voicemail target: 1 day or 2 days\n\nSolide:\n- Website target: 1 day or 2 days\n- Voicemail target: 1 day or 2 days\n\nTruvest:\n- Website target: 2 days or 3 days\n- Voicemail target: 1 day or 2 days\n\nStep 4: Determine the statement that is NOT true\nNow, let's analyze each statement and determine which one is NOT true:\n\n(A) Image's website target is 1 day.\nThis statement is possible based on the combinations we determined.

Therefore, it could be true.\n\n(D) Truvest's website target is 2 days.\nThis statement is possible based on the combinations we determined. Therefore, it could be true.\n\n(E) Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.\nThis statement is NOT possible based on the combinations we determined. Truvest's voicemail target can be either 1 day or 2 days, but not necessarily 2 days.

Each client has two service targets - one for requests received through the website and one for requests received by voicemail. We need to determine which statement is NOT true based on the given conditions.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the conditions\nLet's analyze the given conditions one by one:\n\n1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.\n2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.\n3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\n\nStep 3: Determine the possible combinations\nBased on the given conditions, let's determine the possible combinations for the service targets:\n\n- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. This means Image's voicemail target cannot be 3 days.\n- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. This means Image's website target cannot be longer than its voicemail target.\n- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. This means Solide's website target cannot be 3 days.\n\nBased on these conditions, the possible combinations for the service targets are as follows:\n\nImage:\n- Website target: 1 day or 2 days\n- Voicemail target: 1 day or 2 days\n\nSolide:\n- Website target: 1 day or 2 days\n- Voicemail target: 1 day or 2 days\n\nTruvest:\n- Website target: 2 days or 3 days\n- Voicemail target: 1 day or 2 days\n\nStep 4: Determine the statement that is NOT true\nNow, let's analyze each statement and determine which one is NOT true:\n\n(A) Image's website target is 1 day.\nThis statement is possible based on the combinations we determined. Therefore, it could be true.\n\n(B) Solide's website target is 2 days.\nThis statement is possible based on the combinations we determined. Therefore, it could be true.\n\n(C) Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.\nThis statement is possible based on the combinations we determined. Therefore, it could be true.\n\n(D) Truvest's website target is 2 days.\nThis statement is possible based on the combinations we determined. Therefore, it could be true.\n\n(E) Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.\nThis statement is NOT possible based on the combinations we determined. Truvest's voicemail target can be either 1 day or 2 days, but not necessarily 2 days.

Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\n\nStep 3: Determine the possible targets for each client\nBased on the conditions, let's determine the possible targets for each client:\n\nImage:\n- Voicemail target: 1 day (shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets)\n- Website target: 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days (since it cannot be longer than the voicemail target)\n\nSolide:\n- Website target: 1 day or 2 days (since it must be shorter than Truvest's website target)\n- Voicemail target: 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days (no specific condition)\n\nTruvest:\n- Website target: 2 days or 3 days (no specific condition)\n- Voicemail target: 2 days or 3 days (no specific condition)\n\nStep 4: Determine the targets that can be set for more than one client\nBased on the possible targets for each client, let's determine the targets that can be set for more than one client:\n\n- 1-day website target: This can be set for Image and Solide.\n- 2-day voicemail target: This can be set for Solide and Truvest.\n- 2-day website target: This can be set for Solide and Truvest.\n- 3-day voicemail target: This can be set for Truvest and Image.\n- 3-day website target: This can be set for Truvest and Image.\n\nStep 5: Determine the target that CANNOT be set for more than one client\nBased on the analysis in step 4, we can see that the target that CANNOT be set for more than one client is:\n\n(B) a 2-day voicemail target\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) a 2-day voicemail target.",

Therefore, J cannot be first.\n- Since J must be earlier than G, J cannot be second either.\n- If J is not first or second, then J must be third.\n- Since G must be earlier than R, R cannot be fifth.\n- Since G is fourth, the positions before G must be filled with articles covering finance (H) and nutrition (Q, R, S).\n- Since S must be earlier than Y, S cannot be sixth.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the answer choices:\n(A) H is fifth: This is possible since H can be placed before G.\n(B) J is first: This is not possible since J must be third.\n(C) Q is second: This is not possible since J must be third and Q cannot be earlier than S.\n(D) S is fifth: This is not possible since S cannot be sixth.\n(E) Y is sixth: This is not possible since S must be earlier than Y.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion:\nBased on the given conditions and the fact that G is fourth, the only possible option is (A) H is fifth."

Therefore, Q cannot be first.\n\nStep 7: Analyze the remaining options:\n- (A) G is fourth: This contradicts the condition that G must be earlier than R.\n- (B) H is sixth: There is no information given about the position of H, so this option is possible.\n- (C) Q is first: This contradicts the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.\n- (D) S is second: This contradicts the condition that S must be earlier than Y.\n- (E) Y is fifth: This contradicts the condition that S must be earlier than Y.\n\nStep 8: Conclusion:\nBased on the given conditions, the only option that could be true is (B) H is sixth."

If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.\n\nWhich one of the following is a possible selection of employees for the team?\n\n(A)Myers, Paine, Schmidt, and Thomson\n(B)Ortega, Paine, Thomson, and Zayre\n(C)Paine, Schmidt, Yoder, and Zayre\n(D)Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre\n(E)Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre\n\nSolution: Step 1: Identify the constraints and conditions given in the problem.\n\n- If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.\n- If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.\n- If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.\n\nStep 2: Determine the minimum number of employees required for the team.\n\nThe problem states that the team must include at least four employees.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option based on the given conditions.\n\n(A) Myers, Paine, Schmidt, and Thomson\n- This option violates the condition that if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, this option is not possible.\n\n(B) Ortega, Paine, Thomson, and Zayre\n- This option does not violate any of the given conditions. However, it only includes three employees, which is less than the required minimum of four. Therefore, this option is not possible.\n\n(C) Paine, Schmidt, Yoder, and Zayre\n- This option does not violate any of the given conditions. It includes four employees, which meets the minimum requirement. Therefore, this option is possible.\n\n(D) Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre\n- This option does not violate any of the given conditions. It includes four employees, which meets the minimum requirement. Therefore, this option is possible.\n\n(E) Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre\n- This option violates the condition that if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, this option is not possible.\n\nStep 4: Determine the possible selection of employees for the team.\n\nBased on the evaluation of each option, the possible selection of employees for the team is:\n\n- (C) Paine, Schmidt, Yoder, and Zayre\n- (D) Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is either (C) or (D)."

The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.\n\nIf the lecture on terns is given in Howard Auditorium, which one of the following could be true of the third lecture?\n\n(A)It is on oystercatchers and is in Gladwyn Hall.\n(B)It is on rails and is in Howard Auditorium.\n(C)It is on rails and is in Gladwyn Hall.\n(D)It is on sandpipers and is in Howard Auditorium.\n(E)It is on terns and is in Howard Auditorium.\n\nSolution: Step 1: Identify the given information and conditions:\n- The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.\n- The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.\n- Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.\n- The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.\n- The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.\n- The lecture on terns is given in Howard Auditorium.\n\nStep 2: Determine the order of the lectures:\nBased on the given conditions, we can deduce the following order of the lectures:\n1. Gladwyn Hall - Lecture on ?\n2. ?\n3. Gladwyn Hall - Lecture on ?\n4. Howard Auditorium - Lecture on ?\n5. Howard Auditorium - Lecture on ?\n\nStep 3: Determine the possible options for the third lecture:\nSince the lecture on terns is given in Howard Auditorium, the third lecture cannot be on terns. Therefore, the possible options for the third lecture are:\n- Oystercatchers\n- Rails\n- Sandpipers\n\nStep 4: Apply the remaining conditions to determine the possible options for the third lecture:\n- The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.\n- The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce that the lecture on sandpipers must be before the lecture on oystercatchers, and the lecture on terns must be before the lecture on petrels.\n\nStep 5: Determine the possible options for the third lecture based on the remaining conditions:\n- If the third lecture is on oystercatchers, then the lecture on sandpipers must be before it, which contradicts the condition that the lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium.\n- If the third lecture is on rails, there are no contradictions with the given conditions.\n- If the third lecture is on sandpipers, then the lecture on terns must be before it, which contradicts the condition that the lecture on terns is given in Howard Auditorium.\n\nTherefore, the only possible option for the third lecture is:\n(B) It is on rails and is in Howard Auditorium."

Therefore, the percussionist must perform either the first or second solo.\n- If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo (since the percussionist performs before the saxophonist). This would contradict the previous deduction that the saxophonist performs either the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo. Therefore, the percussionist must perform the second solo.\n\nStep 4: Determine the order of the solos based on the deductions:\n- Based on the deductions from Step 2 and Step 3, we have the following possibilities for the order of the solos:\n  1. Percussionist (2nd solo), Guitarist (1st solo), Keyboard player (3rd solo), Violinist (4th solo), Saxophonist (5th solo), Trumpeter (6th solo)\n  2. Percussionist (2nd solo), Guitarist (1st solo), Keyboard player (3rd solo), Violinist (4th solo), Trumpeter (5th solo), Saxophonist (6th solo)\n\nStep 5: Answer the question:\n- The question asks which one of the following must be true if the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does.\n- From the deductions made in Step 4, we can see that the violinist performs before the saxophonist in both possibilities. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.",

Therefore, the percussionist must perform either the first or second solo.\n- If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo (since the percussionist performs before the saxophonist). This would contradict the previous deduction that the saxophonist performs either the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo. Therefore, the percussionist must perform the second solo.\n\nStep 4: Determine the order of the solos based on the deductions:\n- Based on the deductions from Step 2 and Step 3, we have the following possibilities for the order of the solos:\n  1. Percussionist (2nd solo), Guitarist (1st solo), Keyboard player (3rd solo), Violinist (4th solo), Saxophonist (5th solo), Trumpeter (6th solo)\n  2.

Six colors of thread are available\u2014forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow\u2014exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid\u2014woven in a single color\u2014or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.\n\nIf there are exactly two solid rugs, then the colors of those two rugs CANNOT be\n\n(A)forest and peach\n(B)forest and yellow\n(C)peach and turquoise\n(D)peach and yellow\n(E)turquoise and yellow\n\nSolution: Step 1: Identify the given information and constraints:\n- There are three rugs to be woven.\n- There are six colors of thread available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.\n- Each rug will use exactly five colors.\n- Each color will be used in only one rug.\n- If white is used in a rug, two other colors must also be used.\n- If olive is used in a rug, peach must also be used.\n- Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.\n- Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.\n- Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.\n\nStep 2: Determine the possible combinations of colors for each rug:\n- Rug 1: Since there are three solid rugs, Rug 1 can be solid or multicolored. If Rug 1 is solid, it must use three colors. If Rug 1 is multicolored, it must use five colors.\n- Rug 2: Since there are three solid rugs, Rug 2 can be solid or multicolored. If Rug 2 is solid, it must use three colors. If Rug 2 is multicolored, it must use five colors.\n- Rug 3: Rug 3 must be multicolored and use five colors.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the constraints to eliminate certain color combinations:\n- If white is used in a rug, two other colors must also be used. This means that if white is used in Rug 1 or Rug 2, those rugs must be multicolored.\n- If olive is used in a rug, peach must also be used. This means that if olive is used in Rug 1 or Rug 2, peach must also be used in the same rug.\n- Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug. This means that if forest is used in Rug 1 or Rug 2, turquoise cannot be used in the same rug.\n- Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug. This means that if peach is used in Rug 1 or Rug 2, turquoise cannot be used in the same rug.\n- Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug. This means that if peach is used in Rug 1 or Rug 2, yellow cannot be used in the same rug.\n\nStep 4: Determine the possible color combinations for Rug 1:\n- Rug 1 can be solid or multicolored.\n- If Rug 1 is solid, it must use three colors. The possible combinations are:\n  - (forest, olive, peach)\n  - (forest, olive, turquoise)\n  - (forest, olive, white)\n  - (forest, olive, yellow)\n  - (forest, peach, turquoise)\n  - (forest, peach, white)\n  - (forest, peach, yellow)\n  - (forest, turquoise, white)\n  - (forest, turquoise, yellow)\n  - (forest, white, yellow)\n- If Rug 1 is multicolored, it must use five colors.

Since Hue has two photographs in the Lifestyle section, Fuentes must also have two photographs in the Sports section:\n\nLifestyle: Hue, Hue\nMetro: Fuentes, \nSports: Fuentes, Fuentes\n\nFinally, we need to assign the remaining photographer, Gagnon, to the remaining section, which is Metro:\n\nLifestyle: Hue, Hue\nMetro: Fuentes, Gagnon\nSports: Fuentes, Fuentes\n\nStep 3: Analyze the combinations and determine the answer.\n\nNow that we have assigned the photographers to the sections, we can count the number of photographs by each photographer:\n\nHue: 2\nFuentes: 3\nGagnon: 1\n\nFrom the given options, we can see that the only option that matches the combination we have is (D) Exactly two are by Gagnon.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Exactly two are by Gagnon."

Each day is divided into two nonoverlapping shifts\u2014first and second\u2014with each student working exactly two shifts. Each shift is worked by exactly one of the students according to the following scheduling restrictions: No student works both shifts of any day. On two consecutive days, Louise works the second shift. On two nonconsecutive days, Grecia works the first shift. Katya works on Tuesday and Friday. Hakeem and Joe work on the same day as each other at least once. Grecia and Louise never work on the same day as each other.\n\nWhich one of the following must be true?\n\n(A)Grecia does not work at the gallery on Tuesday.\n(B)Hakeem does not work at the gallery on Wednesday.\n(C)Joe does not work at the gallery on Tuesday.\n(D)Joe does not work at the gallery on Thursday.\n(E)Louise does not work at the gallery on Tuesday.\n\nSolution: Step 1: Identify the given information and constraints:\n- There are five students: Grecia, Hakeem, Joe, Katya, and Louise.\n- The exhibit runs for five days: Monday through Friday.\n- Each day has two shifts: first and second.\n- Each student works exactly two shifts.\n- Louise works the second shift on two consecutive days.\n- Grecia works the first shift on two nonconsecutive days.\n- Katya works on Tuesday and Friday.\n- Hakeem and Joe work on the same day at least once.\n- Grecia and Louise never work on the same day.\n\nStep 2: Create a table to organize the information:\n| Day       | First Shift | Second Shift |\n|-----------|-------------|--------------|\n| Monday    |             |              |\n| Tuesday   |             |              |\n| Wednesday |             |              |\n| Thursday  |             |              |\n| Friday    |             |              |\n\nStep 3: Use the given information to fill in the table:\n- Louise works the second shift on two consecutive days: Based on this, we can determine that Louise works the second shift on Monday and Tuesday.\n| Day       | First Shift | Second Shift |\n|-----------|-------------|--------------|\n| Monday    |             | Louise       |\n| Tuesday   |             | Louise       |\n| Wednesday |             |              |\n| Thursday  |             |              |\n| Friday    |             |              |\n\n- Grecia works the first shift on two nonconsecutive days: Based on this, we can determine that Grecia works the first shift on Wednesday and Friday.\n| Day       | First Shift | Second Shift |\n|-----------|-------------|--------------|\n| Monday    |             | Louise       |\n| Tuesday   |             | Louise       |\n| Wednesday | Grecia      |              |\n| Thursday  |             |              |\n| Friday    | Grecia      |              |\n\n- Katya works on Tuesday and Friday: Based on this, we can determine that Katya works the second shift on Tuesday and the first shift on Friday.\n| Day       | First Shift | Second Shift |\n|-----------|-------------|--------------|\n| Monday    |             | Louise       |\n| Tuesday   |             | Katya        |\n| Wednesday | Grecia      |              |\n| Thursday  |             |              |\n| Friday    | Grecia      | Katya        |\n\n- Hakeem and Joe work on the same day at least once: Based on this, we can determine that Hakeem and Joe work together on Monday or Thursday. Let's try both possibilities:\n1. Hakeem and Joe work on Monday:\n| Day       | First Shift | Second Shift |\n|-----------|-------------|--------------|\n| Monday    | Hakeem      | Louise       |\n| Tuesday   |             | Katya        |\n| Wednesday | Grecia      |              |\n| Thursday  |             |              |\n| Friday    | Grecia      | Katya        |\n\n2. Hakeem and Joe work on Thursday:\n| Day       | First Shift | Second Shift |\n|-----------|-------------|--------------|\n| Monday    |             | Louise       |\n| Tuesday   |             | Katya        |\n| Wednesday | Grecia      |              |\n| Thursday  | Hakeem      | Joe          |\n| Friday    | Grecia      | Katya        |\n\nStep 4: Analyze the options:\n(A) Grecia does not work at the gallery on Tuesday: This is not necessarily true. Grecia could work on Tuesday.\n(B) Hakeem does not work at the gallery on Wednesday: This is not necessarily true. Hakeem could work on Wednesday.\n(C) Joe does not work at the gallery on Tuesday: This is not necessarily true. Joe could work on Tuesday.\n(D) Joe does not work at the gallery on Thursday: This is not necessarily true.

If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.\n\nIf Taylor is not a project member, which one of the following workers must be a project member?\n\n(A)Quinn\n(B)Ruiz\n(C)Verma\n(D)Wells\n(E)Xue\n\nSolution: Step 1: Identify the given information and constraints:\n- There are seven workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue.\n- Three workers will be selected for the project.\n- One of the selected workers will be the project leader.\n- Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.\n- If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.\n- If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.\n\nStep 2: Determine the possible combinations of project members and leaders:\n- Since there are three project members, there are a total of 7C3 = 35 possible combinations.\n- However, we need to consider the constraints mentioned above.\n\nStep 3: Apply the constraints to eliminate certain combinations:\n- Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader. This means that if Quinn or Ruiz is not the project leader, they cannot be a project member. Therefore, any combination that includes Quinn or Ruiz as a project member without being the leader can be eliminated.\n- If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. This means that any combination that includes Smith as a project member without Taylor can be eliminated.\n- If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. This means that any combination that includes Wells as a project member with Ruiz or Verma can be eliminated.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the remaining combinations:\n- After applying the constraints, analyze the remaining combinations to determine which worker must be a project member if Taylor is not.\n- Since Taylor is not a project member, any combination that includes Taylor can be eliminated.\n- Analyze the remaining combinations to find the worker that appears in all of them. This worker must be a project member if Taylor is not.\n\nStep 5: Determine the answer:\n- Based on the analysis in Step 4, identify the worker that appears in all the remaining combinations. This worker must be a project member if Taylor is not.\n\nBy following this step-by-step approach, you can determine the worker that must be a project member if Taylor is not."

Therefore, the fourth audition must be either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.\n\nBased on condition 2, we know that the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, the fifth audition cannot be Kammer's or Lugo's audition.\n\nBased on condition 3, we know that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Therefore, Waite's audition cannot be the fifth audition.\n\nBased on condition 4, we know that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Therefore, Kammer's audition cannot be the sixth audition.\n\nBased on condition 5, we know that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Therefore, Zinn's audition cannot be the sixth audition.\n\nStep 2: Determine the possible options for the sixth audition.\n\nFrom the deductions made in step 1, we can conclude that the possible options for the sixth audition are Trillo's audition and Waite's audition.\n\nStep 3: Determine which option satisfies all the conditions.\n\nFrom condition 3, we know that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Since the fifth audition must be recorded, Waite's audition cannot be the sixth audition.\n\nTherefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is Trillo's audition.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nThe sixth audition could be Trillo's audition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Trillo's audition."

Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.\n\nYoshida's audition could be\n\n(A)fifth\n(B)fourth\n(C)third\n(D)second\n(E)first\n\nSolution: Step 1: Determine the order of the auditions.\n\nFrom the given conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. The fourth audition cannot be recorded.\n2. The fifth audition must be recorded.\n3. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.\n4. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.\n5. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.\n\nLet's start by determining the order of the auditions based on these conditions.\n\nStep 2: Determine the position of the fourth audition.\n\nFrom condition 1, we know that the fourth audition cannot be recorded. Since the fifth audition must be recorded, the fourth audition cannot be the fifth audition. Therefore, the fourth audition must be one of the first three auditions.\n\nStep 3: Determine the position of Waite's audition.\n\nFrom condition 3, we know that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Since the fourth audition cannot be recorded, Waite's audition cannot be the fourth audition. Therefore, Waite's audition must be one of the first three auditions.\n\nStep 4: Determine the position of Kammer's audition.\n\nFrom condition 4, we know that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Since Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, and Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, we can deduce that Kammer's audition must be the first audition.\n\nStep 5: Determine the position of the fifth audition.\n\nFrom condition 2, we know that the fifth audition must be recorded. Since Kammer's audition is the first audition and Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, we can deduce that the fifth audition must be Waite's audition.\n\nStep 6: Determine the position of the fourth audition (continued).\n\nSince the fourth audition cannot be the fifth audition (Waite's audition), and Kammer's audition is the first audition, we can deduce that the fourth audition must be the second or third audition.\n\nStep 7: Determine the position of Zinn's audition.\n\nFrom condition 5, we know that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Since Kammer's audition is the first audition, and Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, we can deduce that Zinn's audition must be the second audition.\n\nStep 8: Determine the position of the fourth audition (continued).\n\nSince Zinn's audition is the second audition, and Kammer's audition is the first audition, we can deduce that the fourth audition must be the third audition.\n\nStep 9: Determine the position of Yoshida's audition.\n\nFrom the remaining positions, we can deduce that Yoshida's audition must be the fourth audition.\n\nStep 10: Determine the remaining position.\n\nThe remaining position is the sixth audition, which must be Trillo's audition.\n\nStep 11: Determine the order of the auditions.\n\nBased on the above deductions, the order of the auditions is as follows:\n\n1. Kammer\n2. Zinn\n3. Yoshida\n4. Trillo\n5. Waite\n6. Lugo\n\nTherefore, Yoshida's audition is the fourth audition.\n\nAnswer: (B) fourth"

Take note of any relationships or dependencies between the clues.\n\nStep 2: Create a chart\nCreate a chart with seven columns representing the seven chapters. Label the columns with the chapter numbers (1-7). This chart will help you visualize the placement of the clues.\n\nStep 3: Start with the given constraint\nSince the question asks for a substitution for the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, start by assuming that T is mentioned in chapter 1. Fill in the chart accordingly.\n\nStep 4: Apply the other constraints\nNow, go through the remaining constraints one by one and apply them to the chart.

Look for a suitable placement for U and X in the chart that satisfies this constraint.\n\nStep 5: Check for any conflicts\nAfter applying all the constraints, check if there are any conflicts or contradictions in the chart. For example, if two clues cannot be placed without violating any constraints, then the given constraints are not solvable.\n\nStep 6: Analyze the substitutions\nNow, go through each of the answer choices and substitute them for the original constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Repeat steps 3-5 for each substitution.\n\nStep 7: Determine the correct substitution\nAnalyze the results of each substitution and determine which one has the same effect in determining the order of the clues as the original constraint.

Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room\u2014walls 1, 2, 3, and 4\u2014with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.\n\nIf Franz's oil is displayed on wall 1, which one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)Franz's watercolor is displayed on wall 4.\n(B)Greene's oil is displayed on wall 2.\n(C)Greene's watercolor is displayed on wall 2.\n(D)Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on wall 3.\n(E)Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 1.\n\nSolution: Step 1: Make a list of the given information:\n- Franz's oil is displayed on wall 1.\n- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.\n- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.\n\nStep 2: Determine the possible positions for the remaining paintings:\n- Since each wall has two positions, there are a total of 8 positions available for the remaining paintings.\n- We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in one of the remaining 7 positions.\n- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in one of the remaining 7 positions.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the given conditions:\n- No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. This means that each wall must have at least one oil painting.\n- No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. This means that each wall must have paintings from at least two different students.\n- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. This means that wall 1 cannot have Isaacs's oil.\n\nStep 4: Determine the possible positions for the remaining paintings based on the given conditions:\n- Since Franz's oil is displayed on wall 1, we can eliminate any positions on wall 1 for the remaining paintings.\n- Since Isaacs's oil cannot be on wall 1, it must be in one of the remaining 7 positions.\n- Since Greene's oil must be displayed in one of the remaining 7 positions, it could be on wall 2.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the answer choices:\n(A) Franz's watercolor is displayed on wall 4. This is possible because we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.\n(B) Greene's oil is displayed on wall 2. This is possible based on our analysis in step 4.\n(C) Greene's watercolor is displayed on wall 2. This is possible because we know that Greene's oil is displayed on wall 2.\n(D) Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on wall 3. This is not possible because we have not determined the positions for Hidalgo's paintings.\n(E) Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 1. This is not possible because we know that Franz's oil is displayed on wall 1.\n\nStep 6: Conclusion:\nBased on our analysis, the answer choices that could be true are (A) Franz's watercolor is displayed on wall 4, (B) Greene's oil is displayed on wall 2, and (C) Greene's watercolor is displayed on wall 2."

The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.\n\nAny one of the following could be true about the organizer's selections of works EXCEPT:\n\n(A)No Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.\n(B)Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected.\n(C)Exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected.\n(D)Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected.\n(E)Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the requirement that no more than four French works are selected. This means that we can select either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 French works.\n\nNext, let's consider the requirement that at least three but no more than four novels are selected. Since there are a total of six novels (three French and three Russian), we can select either 3 or 4 novels.\n\nNow, let's consider the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. This means that if we select 3 novels, we must select at least 2 French novels and 1 Russian novel. If we select 4 novels, we must select at least 3 French novels and 1 Russian novel.\n\nFinally, let's consider the requirement that if both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected. This means that if we select both French plays, we cannot select the Russian play.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement and see if it is possible or not:\n\n(A) No Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.\nThis statement is possible. We can select 0 Russian novels and 1 play, which can be either a French play or the Russian play.\n\n(B) Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected.\nThis statement is possible. We can select 1 Russian novel, both French plays, and one more French work (either a novel or a play).\n\n(C) Exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected.\nThis statement is possible. We can select 2 French novels, the Russian play, and either 1 or 2 more works (which can be either novels or plays).\n\n(D) Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected.\nThis statement is possible. We can select 2 French novels, 2 plays (which can be either French or Russian), and either 1 or 2 more works (which can be either novels or plays).\n\n(E) Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.\nThis statement is not possible. If we select 2 Russian novels, we must select at least 2 French novels. But since we can select at most 4 French works, we cannot select exactly 2 Russian novels and exactly 1 play.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected."

At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\n\nP CANNOT be performed\n\n(A)second\n(B)third\n(C)fourth\n(D)sixth\n(E)seventh\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the condition that P is performed before S. This means that P cannot be performed as the seventh composition, since S is performed after P. Therefore, we can eliminate option (E) as a possibility.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that the eighth composition performed is either L or H. This means that L or H cannot be performed as the second, third, fourth, sixth, or seventh composition. Therefore, we can eliminate options (A), (B), (C), and (D) as possibilities.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that O is performed either first or fifth. If O is performed first, then the order of the compositions could be O, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?. However, this violates the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, since there are no positions available for T to satisfy this condition. Therefore, O cannot be performed first.\n\nThis means that O must be performed fifth. The order of the compositions could be ?, ?, ?, ?, O, ?, ?, ?. However, this violates the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, since there are no positions available for T to satisfy this condition. Therefore, O cannot be performed fifth either.\n\nSince O cannot be performed first or fifth, it must be performed in one of the remaining positions: second, third, fourth, sixth, or seventh. However, we have already eliminated these positions as possibilities for P, L, and H. Therefore, it is not possible to satisfy all of the given conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, P cannot be performed in any position."

If O is performed first, then the order of the compositions could be O, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? (where ? represents any composition). If O is performed fifth, then the order could be ?, ?, ?, ?, O, ?, ?, ?.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that the eighth composition performed is either L or H. If the eighth composition is L, then the order could be ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, L. If the eighth composition is H, then the order could be ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, H.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that P is performed at some time before S. This means that P cannot be the eighth composition performed, so we can eliminate the possibility of P being L or H. Therefore, the order could be ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, P, S.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. This means that either O or S must be performed in the first four compositions, and the other one must be performed in the last four compositions. Let's consider the case where O is performed in the first four compositions. The order could be O, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, P, S. In this case, T cannot be performed immediately after O, so we can eliminate the possibility of O being performed immediately after T. Therefore, O must be performed in the fifth position. The order could be ?, ?, ?, ?, O, ?, P, S. Now, let's consider the case where S is performed in the first four compositions. The order could be S, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, P, S. In this case, T cannot be performed immediately after S, so we can eliminate the possibility of S being performed immediately before T. Therefore, S must be performed in the fifth position. The order could be ?, ?, ?, ?, S, ?, P, S.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. If T is performed immediately before F, then the order could be ?, ?, ?, T, F, ?, P, S. If T is performed immediately after R, then the order could be ?, ?, ?, R, T, ?, P, S.\n\nBased on the conditions given, the possible orders of the compositions are as follows:\n\n1) O, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, P, S\n2) ?, ?, ?, ?, O, ?, P, S\n3) ?, ?, ?, ?, S, ?, P, S\n4) ?, ?, ?, T, F, ?, P, S\n5) ?, ?, ?, R, T, ?, P, S\n\nFrom these possibilities, we can see that F must be performed either second or third. Therefore, the answer is (B) second or third."

So, the breed on day 7 cannot be the same as the breed on day 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. This means that Himalayans cannot be featured on day 2 or day 7.\n\nLastly, Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. This means that Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 2 or day 7.\n\nUsing these conditions, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese\n- This option violates the condition that Himalayans cannot be featured on day 2 or day 7.\n\n(B) Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Manx\n- This option satisfies all the conditions.\n\n(C) Manx, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Manx, Siamese\n- This option violates the condition that Himalayans cannot be featured on day 2 or day 7.\n\n(D) Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Siamese, Himalayan\n- This option violates the condition that Himalayans cannot be featured on day 2 or day 7.\n\n(E) Siamese, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan\n- This option violates the condition that Himalayans cannot be featured on day 2 or day 7.\n\nTherefore, the only option that could be the order in which the breeds of kitten are featured is (B) Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Manx."

The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n\nIf the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:\n\n(A)Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday.\n(B)Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.\n(C)Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday.\n(D)Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday.\n(E)Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the days of the week and the batches of cookies made on each day:\n\nMonday: \nTuesday: Peanut Butter (1st batch)\nWednesday: \nThursday: Sugar (2nd batch)\nFriday: \n\nFrom the given conditions, we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so we can fill in the first batch of cookies for each kind:\n\nMonday: Oatmeal (1st batch)\nTuesday: Peanut Butter (1st batch)\nWednesday: \nThursday: Sugar (2nd batch)\nFriday: \n\nNext, we know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Since the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must also be made on Tuesday:\n\nMonday: Oatmeal (1st batch)\nTuesday: Peanut Butter (1st batch), Oatmeal (2nd batch)\nWednesday: \nThursday: Sugar (2nd batch)\nFriday: \n\nFinally, we know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Since we already have the second batch of oatmeal cookies on Tuesday, the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday:\n\nMonday: Oatmeal (1st batch)\nTuesday: Peanut Butter (1st batch), Oatmeal (2nd batch)\nWednesday: \nThursday: Sugar (2nd batch)\nFriday: \n\nNow, let's go through each statement and see if it could be true:\n\n(A) Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday.\nThis statement is true because both oatmeal and peanut butter cookies have their first batch made on Monday.\n\n(B) Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.\nThis statement is true because both peanut butter and oatmeal cookies have their first batch made on Tuesday.\n\n(C) Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday.\nThis statement is false because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, not Wednesday.\n\n(D) Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday.\nThis statement is true because both oatmeal and sugar cookies have their second batch made on Thursday.\n\n(E) Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday.\nThis statement is true because both oatmeal and sugar cookies have their third batch made on Friday.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday."

The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n\nIf the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.\n(B)The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.\n(C)The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.\n(D)The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.\n(E)The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the days of the week and the batches of cookies made on each day:\n\nMonday: oatmeal, ?, ?\nTuesday: ?, peanut butter, ?\nWednesday: ?, ?, peanut butter\nThursday: ?, sugar, ?\nFriday: ?, ?, sugar\n\nFrom the given conditions, we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so we can fill in the first batch of oatmeal cookies on Monday:\n\nMonday: oatmeal, ?, ?\nTuesday: ?, peanut butter, ?\nWednesday: ?, ?, peanut butter\nThursday: ?, sugar, ?\nFriday: ?, ?, sugar\n\nNext, we know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Since the first batch of oatmeal cookies is on Monday, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must also be on Monday:\n\nMonday: oatmeal, peanut butter, ?\nTuesday: ?, peanut butter, ?\nWednesday: ?, ?, peanut butter\nThursday: ?, sugar, ?\nFriday: ?, ?, sugar\n\nWe also know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Let's fill that in:\n\nMonday: oatmeal, peanut butter, ?\nTuesday: ?, peanut butter, ?\nWednesday: ?, ?, peanut butter\nThursday: ?, sugar, sugar\nFriday: ?, ?, sugar\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of batches made on Friday. We know that it is exactly one. Since there are already two batches of sugar cookies, the only option for the batch made on Friday is the first batch of oatmeal cookies:\n\nMonday: oatmeal, peanut butter, ?\nTuesday: ?, peanut butter, ?\nWednesday: ?, ?, peanut butter\nThursday: ?, sugar, sugar\nFriday: oatmeal, ?, sugar\n\nFrom this, we can see that the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday (option A is false). The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday (option B is false). The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday (option C is false). The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday (option D is false). Therefore, the only option that could be true is that the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday (option E)."

Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nIf Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n(B)Young is assigned parking space #2.\n(C)Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n(D)Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n(E)Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the rules and constraints given:\n\n1.

Therefore, option (A) is not possible.\n\n(B) Young is assigned parking space #2.\nIf Young is assigned parking space #2, then Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, which violates rule 1. Therefore, option (B) is not possible.\n\n(C) Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\nIf Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Robertson, which violates rule 3. Therefore, option (C) is not possible.\n\n(D) Souza is assigned parking space #3.\nIf Souza is assigned parking space #3, then Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, which violates rule 2. Therefore, option (D) is not possible.\n\n(E) Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nIf Vaughn is assigned parking space #4, then Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Vaughn, which is possible according to the given rules.

Since F is not the bicycle Yuki tests on the first day, this statement is possible.\n\n(C) Theresa tests F on the second day.\nAccording to condition 1, Reynaldo cannot test F. Since Theresa can test any bicycle, this statement is possible.\n\n(D) Reynaldo tests H on the first day.\nAccording to condition 1, Reynaldo cannot test F. Since H is not F, this statement is possible.\n\n(E) Yuki tests F on the second day.\nAccording to condition 4, the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n\nWhich one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?\n\n(A)pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant\n(B)pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant\n(C)restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant\n(D)restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy\n(E)restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy\n\nSolution: First, we know that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. This means that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants will be in spaces 1 and 7, but we don't know the exact order yet.\n\nNext, we know that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means that the two restaurants cannot be in spaces 2 and 3 or spaces 5 and 6. So, the two restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 4, spaces 1 and 5, or spaces 1 and 6.\n\nNow, we know that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. This means that the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6.\n\nLastly, we know that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. This means that the toy store cannot be in space 3 or space 7.\n\nLet's go through the answer choices and see which one satisfies all of the constraints:\n\n(A) pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant\n(B) pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant\n(C) restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant\n(D) restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy\n(E) restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy\n\nLooking at the answer choices, we can see that only option (C) satisfies all of the given constraints. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant."

No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?\n\n(A)zero\n(B)one\n(C)two\n(D)three\n(E)four\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the condition that the third solo is a traditional piece. This means that the first two solos must be modern pieces.\n\nSince no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece, Wayne cannot perform the first solo. Therefore, Zara must perform the first solo, and it must be a modern piece.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. Since the third solo is a traditional piece, the fourth solo must also be a traditional piece.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that in the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. Since Zara performed the first solo, Wayne must perform the fourth solo, and it must be a traditional piece.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that the pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. Since Zara performed the first solo, she cannot perform the second solo. Therefore, Wayne must perform the second solo.\n\nFinally, let's consider the remaining solos. The fifth solo must be a modern piece, and since Zara cannot perform it, Wayne must perform it.\n\nBased on these conditions, we can determine that Wayne performs a traditional piece in the third and fourth solos. Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is two.\n\nThe answer is (C) two."

This means that J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.\n\nNext, let's consider the rule that K cannot be shown in the morning. This means that K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.\n\nNow, let's consider the rule that L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. This means that L cannot be shown in the morning or evening. It must be shown in the afternoon.\n\nBased on these rules, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n(A) K is shown at some time after J is shown.\nThis statement is not possible because J must be shown in the evening, and K cannot be shown in the morning.\n\n(B) L is shown at some time after J is shown.\nThis statement is possible. Since J is shown in the evening, L can be shown in the afternoon.\n\n(C) P is shown at some time after J is shown.\nThis statement is possible. Since J is shown in the evening, P can be shown in the afternoon.\n\n(D) Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown.\nThis statement is not possible because it does not follow any of the given rules.\n\n(E) Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown.\nThis statement is possible. Since K can be shown in the afternoon or evening, both N and P can be shown in the afternoon.\n\nBased on our evaluation, the answer is (B) L is shown at some time after J is shown and (C) P is shown at some time after J is shown."

Two service targets are set for each client\u2014one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\n\nIf none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:\n\n(A)Image's website target is 1 day.\n(B)Solide's website target is 2 days.\n(C)Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.\n(D)Truvest's website target is 2 days.\n(E)Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the possible combinations of website and voicemail targets for each client:\n\nImage: \n- Website target: 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days\n- Voicemail target: 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days\n\nSolide: \n- Website target: 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days\n- Voicemail target: 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days\n\nTruvest: \n- Website target: 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days\n- Voicemail target: 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days\n\nNow let's consider the given conditions:\n\n1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.\nThis means that for each client, the website target must be equal to or shorter than the voicemail target.\n\n2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.\nThis means that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than Solide's and Truvest's voicemail targets.\n\n3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nThis means that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\n\nNow let's analyze each answer choice:\n\n(A) Image's website target is 1 day.\nThis is a possible scenario, as Image's website target can be 1 day.\n\n(B) Solide's website target is 2 days.\nThis is a possible scenario, as Solide's website target can be 2 days.\n\n(C) Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.\nThis is a possible scenario, as Solide's voicemail target can be 2 days.\n\n(D) Truvest's website target is 2 days.\nThis is a possible scenario, as Truvest's website target can be 2 days.\n\n(E) Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.\nThis is not a possible scenario, as Truvest's voicemail target cannot be 2 days since none of the clients can have a voicemail target of 3 days.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days."

Since Image's website target is already 2 days, Solide's website target cannot be 2 days.\n\nTherefore, the target that must also be 2 days is not Solide's website target.\n\nThis leaves us with two options: Solide's voicemail target and Truvest's voicemail target.\n\nSince Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Solide's voicemail target is the only remaining option, we can conclude that Solide's voicemail target must also be 2 days.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Solide's voicemail target."

This means that the order of these three articles must be J, G, R.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that S must be earlier than Y. This means that S cannot be the last article to be edited, so Y must be the last article.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Since Y is the last article, S cannot be earlier than Q. Therefore, Q must be the third article.\n\nNow, we have determined the order of J, G, R, Q, and Y. The remaining articles are H and G. Since consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, H cannot be second. Therefore, option (B) H is second is not possible.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining options:\n\n(A) G is second: This is possible, as G can be the second article to be edited after H.\n\n(C) S is second: This is not possible, as S cannot be earlier than Q, which must be the third article.\n\n(D) R is third: This is possible, as R can be the third article to be edited after J and G.\n\n(E) Y is third: This is not possible, as Y must be the last article to be edited.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) G is second."

Since G must be edited before R, and R must be edited before H, the order of the first three articles must be J, G, R. This means that the fourth article must be H. After that, we have two articles left from the nutrition category (Q and S) and one article from the wildlife category (Y). Since S must be earlier than Y, the order of the last three articles must be S, Y, Q. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if H is fourth.\n\nIf Y is fifth, it means that the first four articles must be from the finance and nutrition categories (G, H, J, and one more).

This option could be a valid schedule.\n\n(B) the sci-fi film, the mystery\n- This option satisfies all the conditions, as the mystery is not shown on screen 2 and the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. This option could be a valid schedule.\n\n(C) the sci-fi film, the western\n- This option violates the condition that the western begins before the horror film. The western cannot be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M. This option is not valid.\n\n(D) the western, the horror film\n- This option satisfies all the conditions, as the horror film is not shown on screen 2 and the western is not shown on screen 3. This option could be a valid schedule.\n\n(E) the western, the mystery\n- This option satisfies all the conditions, as the mystery is not shown on screen 2 and the western is not shown on screen 3.

Therefore, the romance must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2.\n\nFrom the deductions we made earlier, we know that the horror film and the mystery cannot be shown on the same screen. Since the romance cannot be shown on screen 2, it must be shown on screen 1. Therefore, the horror film must be shown on screen 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) The horror film is shown on screen 1. This is true based on our deductions.\n(B) The mystery begins at 7 P.M. This is not necessarily true. The mystery could begin at either 7 P.M. or 9 P.M.\n(C) The mystery is shown on screen 2.

The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.\n\nBased on these conditions, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- The western cannot be shown on screen 3 because the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.\n- The romance cannot be shown on screen 2 because the romance is not shown on screen 2.\n- The horror film and the mystery cannot be shown on the same screen because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"If the romance is scheduled to begin before the western does.\" If the romance is scheduled to begin before the western, it means that the romance cannot be shown on screen 3 because screen 3 shows a movie at 8 P.M., which is before the 9 P.M. slot. Therefore, the romance must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2.\n\nFrom the deductions we made earlier, we know that the horror film and the mystery cannot be shown on the same screen. Since the romance cannot be shown on screen 2, it must be shown on screen 1. Therefore, the horror film must be shown on screen 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) The horror film is shown on screen 1. This is true based on our deductions.\n(B) The mystery begins at 7 P.M. This is not necessarily true. The mystery could begin at either 7 P.M. or 9 P.M.\n(C) The mystery is shown on screen 2. This is not true because the horror film is shown on screen 2.\n(D) The sci-fi film begins at 9 P.M. This is not necessarily true. The sci-fi film could begin at either 7 P.M. or 9 P.M.\n(E) The sci-fi film is shown on screen 2.

Therefore, option (D) is true.\n\nFinally, let's consider option (E), which states that the keyboard player performs a solo before the saxophonist does.

During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.\n\nEach of the following must be false EXCEPT:\n\n(A)The keyboard player performs the first solo.\n(B)The guitarist performs the second solo.\n(C)The guitarist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.\n(D)The guitarist performs a solo at some time before the percussionist does.\n(E)The keyboard player performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the restriction that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. This means that the guitarist can perform the first, second, or third solo.\n\nNext, let's consider the restriction that the percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does. This means that the percussionist cannot perform the last solo, so they must perform either the first, second, or third solo.\n\nNow, let's consider the restriction that the keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does. This means that the keyboard player cannot perform the first solo, as the violinist must perform before them. Additionally, the keyboard player cannot perform the last solo, as the guitarist must perform after them. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform the second or third solo.\n\nNext, let's consider the restriction that the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. This means that the saxophonist cannot perform the first solo, as the percussionist must perform before them. Additionally, the saxophonist cannot perform the last solo, as the trumpeter must perform after them. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform the second or third solo.\n\nBased on these restrictions, we can eliminate options (A) and (B) as false. The keyboard player cannot perform the first solo, and the guitarist cannot perform the second solo.\n\nNow, let's consider option (C), which states that the guitarist performs a solo before the saxophonist does. This is possible, as the guitarist can perform the first or second solo, and the saxophonist can perform the second or third solo. Therefore, option (C) is true.\n\nNext, let's consider option (D), which states that the guitarist performs a solo before the percussionist does. This is also possible, as the guitarist can perform the first or second solo, and the percussionist can perform the first or second solo. Therefore, option (D) is true.\n\nFinally, let's consider option (E), which states that the keyboard player performs a solo before the saxophonist does. This is possible, as the keyboard player can perform the second or third solo, and the saxophonist can perform the second or third solo. Therefore, option (E) is true.\n\nBased on our analysis, all options are true, so the answer is (D) The guitarist performs a solo at some time before the percussionist does."

Six colors of thread are available\u2014forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow\u2014exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid\u2014woven in a single color\u2014or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.\n\nIf one of the rugs is solid yellow, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:\n\n(A)There is exactly one solid color rug.\n(B)One of the rugs is solid forest.\n(C)Turquoise is not used in any of the rugs.\n(D)Forest and olive are used together in a rug.\n(E)Peach and white are used together in a rug.\n\nSolution: First, let's list out the given information and rules:\n\n- There are 6 colors available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.\n- Exactly 5 colors will be used to weave the rugs.\n- Each color used will be used in only one of the rugs.\n- In any rug with white, two other colors are also used.\n- In any rug with olive, peach is also used.\n- Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.\n- Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.\n- Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement and see if it could be true or not if one of the rugs is solid yellow:\n\n(A) There is exactly one solid color rug.\nIf one of the rugs is solid yellow, it means that yellow is used in only one rug. This means that there could be exactly one solid color rug. So, statement (A) could be true.\n\n(B) One of the rugs is solid forest.\nIf one of the rugs is solid yellow, it means that yellow is used in only one rug. This means that forest could be used in another rug, but it doesn't necessarily have to be solid forest. So, statement (B) could be true.\n\n(C) Turquoise is not used in any of the rugs.\nIf one of the rugs is solid yellow, it means that yellow is used in only one rug. This means that turquoise could be used in another rug, but it doesn't necessarily have to be excluded from all the rugs. So, statement (C) could be true.\n\n(D) Forest and olive are used together in a rug.\nIf one of the rugs is solid yellow, it means that yellow is used in only one rug. This means that forest and olive could be used together in another rug. So, statement (D) could be true.\n\n(E) Peach and white are used together in a rug.\nIf one of the rugs is solid yellow, it means that yellow is used in only one rug. This means that peach and white could be used together in another rug. So, statement (E) could be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, all of the statements (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) could be true if one of the rugs is solid yellow. Therefore, the answer is none of the above."

Therefore, Stanton cannot be the last person recruited either, because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.\n\nSo, we can eliminate option (E) seventh.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining options:\n\n(A) first: This is a possibility, as there is no information that contradicts Stanton being the first person recruited.\n\n(B) second: This is a possibility, as there is no information that contradicts Stanton being the second person recruited.\n\n(C) third: This is a possibility, as there is no information that contradicts Stanton being the third person recruited.\n\n(D) fifth: This is a possibility, as there is no information that contradicts Stanton being the fifth person recruited.\n\nSince there is no information that contradicts Stanton being recruited in any of the remaining positions, we cannot definitively determine which option is correct based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is inconclusive."

Since we know that one photograph in the Sports section is by Fuentes, this means that Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, option (E) - neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue - is not possible.\n\nThis leaves us with options (A) - both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, and (C) - exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is either (A) or (C).",

The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.\n\nWhich one of the following could be an accurate assignment of students, in order from the earliest year to the latest?\n\n(A)Louis, Onyx, Ryan, Yoshio\n(B)Mollie, Yoshio, Tiffany, Onyx\n(C)Onyx, Ryan, Louis, Tiffany\n(D)Tiffany, Onyx, Louis, Ryan\n(E)Yoshio, Onyx, Louis, Mollie\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. This means that if Tiffany is assigned to the project, Louis cannot be assigned to 1923. \n\nNext, let's consider the condition that if Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. This means that if Mollie is assigned, she cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that if Tiffany is assigned to the project, Ryan must be assigned to the project. This means that if Tiffany is assigned, Ryan cannot be left out.\n\nLastly, let's consider the condition that if Ryan is assigned to the project, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This means that if Ryan is assigned, Onyx must be assigned to 1922.\n\nNow, let's go through the answer choices and see which one satisfies all the conditions:\n\n(A) Louis, Onyx, Ryan, Yoshio - This assignment does not satisfy the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.\n\n(B) Mollie, Yoshio, Tiffany, Onyx - This assignment satisfies all the conditions. Mollie can be assigned to 1921, Yoshio to 1922, Tiffany to 1923, and Onyx to 1924.\n\n(C) Onyx, Ryan, Louis, Tiffany - This assignment does not satisfy the condition that if Tiffany is assigned, Ryan must be assigned.\n\n(D) Tiffany, Onyx, Louis, Ryan - This assignment satisfies all the conditions. Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, Onyx to 1922, Louis to 1921, and Ryan to 1924.\n\n(E) Yoshio, Onyx, Louis, Mollie - This assignment does not satisfy the condition that if Tiffany is assigned, Ryan must be assigned.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Mollie, Yoshio, Tiffany, Onyx."

Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students\u2014Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio\u2014are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.\n\nIf both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?\n\n(A)Louis is assigned to 1923.\n(B)Mollie is assigned to 1921.\n(C)Onyx is assigned to 1922.\n(D)Tiffany is assigned to 1924.\n(E)Yoshio is assigned to 1922.\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the condition that if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?\n\n(A) Louis is assigned to 1923.\n(B) Mollie is assigned to 1921.\n(C) Onyx is assigned to 1922.\n(D) Tiffany is assigned to 1924.\n(E) Yoshio is assigned to 1922.\n\nWe know that if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. So if Ryan is assigned to 1924, then Onyx must be assigned to 1923. However, if Yoshio is assigned to 1922, then Onyx cannot be assigned to 1923. Therefore, option (C) Onyx is assigned to 1922 cannot be true.\n\nNow let's consider the other conditions. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.\n\nIf both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, it means that Ryan is assigned to the project. Therefore, Tiffany must also be assigned to the project. This means that Ryan is assigned to 1924 and Tiffany is assigned to 1923.\n\nNow, if Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. However, both of these years are already assigned to Louis and Yoshio. Therefore, option (B) Mollie is assigned to 1921 cannot be true.\n\nFinally, let's consider the remaining options. Louis is assigned to 1923, which is not possible because Tiffany is assigned to 1923. Yoshio is assigned to 1922, which is possible because Ryan is assigned to 1924. Therefore, option (E) Yoshio is assigned to 1922 could be true.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (E) Yoshio is assigned to 1922."

The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.

If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then no other student can be assigned to 1922.\n\nNext, let's consider the condition that if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.

Therefore, T must be mentioned in either chapter 4, chapter 5, or chapter 6.\n- Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or chapter 7. Therefore, S must be mentioned in either chapter 1, chapter 2, or chapter 3.\n- Since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4. Therefore, W must be mentioned in either chapter 5, chapter 6, or chapter 7.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\n(A) R is mentioned in chapter 1.\nIf R is mentioned in chapter 1, then S must be mentioned in chapter 2 (constraint 3). However, this violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, option (A) is not possible.\n\n(B) R is mentioned in chapter 5.\nIf R is mentioned in chapter 5, then S must be mentioned in chapter 6 (constraint 3). However, this violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, option (B) is not possible.\n\n(C) S is mentioned in chapter 7.\nIf S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6 (constraint 3). However, this violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, option (C) is not possible.\n\n(D) W is mentioned in chapter 6.\nIf W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4 (constraint 2). This leaves chapter 5 for X. Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, U must be mentioned in chapter 3. This satisfies all the constraints, so option (D) is possible.\n\n(E) X is mentioned in chapter 4.\nIf X is mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 6 (constraint 2). This leaves chapter 5 for W. Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, U must be mentioned in chapter 3. This satisfies all the constraints, so option (E) is possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is either option (D) or option (E)."

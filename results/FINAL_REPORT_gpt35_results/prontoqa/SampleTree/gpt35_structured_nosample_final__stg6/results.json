According to the problem statement, each prime number is a natural number and each natural number is not negative. Therefore, 31, being a prime number, is not negative.\nTo determine if 31 is a Mersenne prime, we need to check if it is a prime number and if it can be expressed in the form 2^p - 1, where p is a prime number.\n\nFirst, we check if 31 is a prime number.\nTo determine if 31 is not composite, we need to check if 31 is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.\n\nChecking if 31 is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself:\n31 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.\n\nTherefore, 31 is not composite.\nTo determine if 31 is a natural number, we need to check if it is a positive integer.\n\nChecking if 31 is a positive integer:\n31 is a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, 31 is a natural number.\nTo determine if 31 is not negative, we need to check if 31 is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nChecking if 31 is greater than or equal to 0:\n31 is greater than 0.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"31 is not negative\" is true.\n\n### Answer ###\nTrue. 31 is not negative.\n",

Therefore, we can conclude that cats are not cold-blooded.\n\nSo, the statement \"Wren is cold-blooded\" is false.\nSince we have already determined that cats are not cold-blooded, we do not need to determine if every carnivore is a mammal. Therefore, we can skip this step.\n### Step to Execute ###\n If every carnivore is a mammal, determine if mammals are cold-blooded. "

Each integer is a real number. Real numbers are numbers. Every complex number is imaginary. Each real number is not imaginary. Prime numbers are natural numbers. Natural numbers are integers. 127 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 127 is not imaginary.\n### Goal ###\nThe goal of this problem is to determine whether the statement \"127 is not imaginary\" is true or false.### Steps ###\nTo determine if 127 is a Mersenne prime, we need to check if it is of the form 2^p - 1, where p is a prime number.\nTo check if 127 is a prime number, we need to test if it is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of 127.\nTo verify if 127 is not imaginary, we need to check if it is a real number.\nThe result from step 3 is that 127 is a real number. \n\nComparing this with the statement \"127 is not imaginary\", we can conclude that the statement is true. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is: True, 127 is not imaginary.\n"

The answer to the question \"Stella is not small\" is inconclusive.\nThe statements that provide information about the size of arthropods and invertebrates are:\n\n1. Every arthropod is small.\n2. Every whale is not small.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that all arthropods are small.

The answer to the question \"Stella is not small\" is inconclusive.\nBased on the information from steps 2 and 3, we know that Stella is a lepidopteran and lepidopterans are insects. We also know that every insect is an arthropod and every arthropod is small.

Sam is a butterfly.\nTrue or false: Sam is not bony.\n### Goal ###\nThe goal of this problem is to determine whether Sam is bony or not based on the given statements.### Steps ###\nButterflies are lepidopterans.\nTo determine if lepidopterans are insects, we can refer to the previous step which states that butterflies are lepidopterans. Since butterflies are a type of lepidopteran and lepidopterans are insects, we can conclude that lepidopterans are indeed insects.\nTo determine if insects are arthropods, we can refer to the information provided in the problem statement. The problem statement states that insects are arthropods. Therefore, it is true that insects are arthropods.\nTo determine if arthropods are bony, we can refer to the information provided in the problem statement. The problem statement states that arthropods are not bony. Therefore, it is true that arthropods are not bony.\nSince arthropods are not bony, we can conclude that Sam, who is a butterfly, is also not bony.

Every animal is not unicellular. Every butterfly is a lepidopteran. Each insect is six-legged. Arthropods are not bony. Sam is a butterfly.\nTrue or false: Sam is not bony.\n### Goal ###\nThe goal of this problem is to determine whether Sam is bony or not based on the given statements.### Steps ###\nButterflies are lepidopterans.\nTo determine if lepidopterans are insects, we can refer to the previous step which states that butterflies are lepidopterans. Since butterflies are a type of lepidopteran and lepidopterans are insects, we can conclude that lepidopterans are indeed insects.\nTo determine if insects are arthropods, we can refer to the information provided in the problem statement. The problem statement states that insects are arthropods. Therefore, it is true that insects are arthropods.\nTo determine if arthropods are bony, we can refer to the information provided in the problem statement.

Every real number is not imaginary. 127 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 127 is negative.\n### Goal ###\nThe goal of this problem is to determine whether the statement \"127 is negative\" is true or false.### Steps ###\nTo determine if 127 is a Mersenne prime, we need to check if it is a prime number and if it can be expressed in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer.\n\nFirst, we check if 127 is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. \n\nTo check if 127 is prime, we can divide it by all natural numbers less than its square root (approximately 11.27). If none of these numbers divide 127 evenly, then it is a prime number.\n\nDividing 127 by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, we find that none of these numbers divide 127 evenly. Therefore, 127 is a prime number.\n\nNext, we check if 127 can be expressed in the form 2^n - 1. \n\nWe can try different values of n and check if 2^n - 1 equals 127. \n\nFor n = 7, 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127. Therefore, 127 can be expressed in the form 2^n - 1.\n\nSince 127 is both a prime number and can be expressed in the form 2^n - 1, it is a Mersenne prime.\n\nNow, let's determine if 127 is negative.\n127 is a Mersenne prime, so it is not negative.\nSince 127 is a Mersenne prime, it is not negative.\nBased on the results from steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that 127 is not negative. Therefore, the answer to the problem is false.\n",

Every real number is not imaginary. 127 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 127 is negative.\n### Goal ###\nThe goal of this problem is to determine whether the statement \"127 is negative\" is true or false.### Steps ###\nTo determine if 127 is a Mersenne prime, we need to check if it is a prime number and if it can be expressed in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer.\n\nFirst, we check if 127 is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. \n\nTo check if 127 is prime, we can divide it by all natural numbers less than its square root (approximately 11.27). If none of these numbers divide 127 evenly, then it is a prime number.\n\nDividing 127 by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, we find that none of these numbers divide 127 evenly. Therefore, 127 is a prime number.\n\nNext, we check if 127 can be expressed in the form 2^n - 1. \n\nWe can try different values of n and check if 2^n - 1 equals 127. \n\nFor n = 7, 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127. Therefore, 127 can be expressed in the form 2^n - 1.\n\nSince 127 is both a prime number and can be expressed in the form 2^n - 1, it is a Mersenne prime.\n\nNow, let's determine if 127 is negative.\n127 is a Mersenne prime, so it is not negative.\nSince 127 is a Mersenne prime, it is not negative.\nBased on the results from steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that 127 is not negative. Therefore, the answer to the problem is false.\n"

Every integer is a real number. Mersenne primes are prime numbers. Natural numbers are integers. Complex numbers are imaginary. Prime numbers are prime. Real numbers are numbers. Mersenne primes are prime. 131071 is a prime number.\nTrue or false: 131071 is not imaginary.\n\nSolution: Step 1: Understand the problem.\nThe problem is asking whether 131071 is imaginary or not.\n\nStep 2: Recall the definition of imaginary numbers.\nImaginary numbers are numbers that can be written in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit (\u221a-1).\n\nStep 3: Recall the definition of real numbers.\nReal numbers are numbers that can be represented on the number line. They include rational numbers (fractions) and irrational numbers (such as \u221a2 or \u03c0).\n\nStep 4: Determine if 131071 is imaginary or not.\nSince 131071 is a prime number, it is a natural number, an integer, and a real number. However, it is not an imaginary number because it cannot be written in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question.\nTherefore, the statement \"131071 is not imaginary\" is true."

Each integer is a real number. Real numbers are numbers. Every complex number is imaginary. Each real number is not imaginary. Prime numbers are natural numbers. Natural numbers are integers. 127 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 127 is not imaginary.\n\nSolution: Step 1: Determine the definition of an imaginary number.\nAn imaginary number is defined as a number that can be written as the product of a real number and the imaginary unit i, where i is defined as the square root of -1.\n\nStep 2: Determine the definition of a Mersenne prime.\nA Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer.\n\nStep 3: Determine the definition of a prime number.\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nStep 4: Determine the definition of a natural number.\nA natural number is a positive integer (including zero).\n\nStep 5: Determine the definition of an integer.\nAn integer is a whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero.\n\nStep 6: Determine the definition of a real number.\nA real number is a number that can be represented on the number line, including integers, fractions, and irrational numbers.\n\nStep 7: Determine the definition of a complex number.\nA complex number is a number that can be written in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nStep 8: Determine if 127 is a Mersenne prime.\nTo determine if 127 is a Mersenne prime, we need to check if it can be written in the form 2^n - 1. In this case, n would be 7, since 2^7 - 1 = 127. Therefore, 127 is a Mersenne prime.\n\nStep 9: Determine if 127 is imaginary.\nSince 127 is a Mersenne prime, and Mersenne primes are prime numbers, we can conclude that 127 is a prime number. Prime numbers are natural numbers, and natural numbers are integers. Integers are real numbers, and real numbers are not imaginary. Therefore, we can conclude that 127 is not imaginary.\n\nFinal answer: False. 127 is not imaginary."

None of the statements indicate that Fae is eight-legged. Therefore, the statement \"Fae is eight-legged\" is false."

This is because there is no real number b that can be multiplied by the imaginary unit i to give 31.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion.\nBased on the steps above, we can conclude that 31 is not an imaginary number.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"31 is imaginary\" is false."

Natural numbers are not negative. Each integer is a real number. Each real number is not imaginary. Mersenne primes are prime. Each natural number is an integer. Negative numbers are negative. Real numbers are numbers. 127 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 127 is negative.\n\nSolution: Step 1: Understand the problem.\nWe are given the statement \"127 is a Mersenne prime\" and we need to determine if the number 127 is negative.\n\nStep 2: Recall the properties of Mersenne primes.\nA Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer.\n\nStep 3: Determine if 127 is a Mersenne prime.\nTo determine if 127 is a Mersenne prime, we need to check if it can be written in the form 2^n - 1. Let's try different values of n and see if any of them satisfy the equation.\n\nFor n = 1: 2^1 - 1 = 1, not equal to 127.\nFor n = 2: 2^2 - 1 = 3, not equal to 127.\nFor n = 3: 2^3 - 1 = 7, not equal to 127.\nFor n = 4: 2^4 - 1 = 15, not equal to 127.\nFor n = 5: 2^5 - 1 = 31, not equal to 127.\nFor n = 6: 2^6 - 1 = 63, not equal to 127.\nFor n = 7: 2^7 - 1 = 127, equal to 127.\n\nSince 127 can be written in the form 2^7 - 1, it is a Mersenne prime.\n\nStep 4: Determine if 127 is negative.\nSince we have determined that 127 is a Mersenne prime, and Mersenne primes are not negative, we can conclude that 127 is not negative.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"127 is negative\" is false."

Complex numbers are imaginary. Prime numbers are not composite. Every integer is a real number. Each Mersenne prime is prime. Natural numbers are integers. Real numbers are numbers. Natural numbers are positive. 131071 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 131071 is imaginary.\n\nSolution: Step 1: Recall the definition of an imaginary number. An imaginary number is a number that can be written as the product of a real number and the imaginary unit i, where i is defined as the square root of -1.\n\nStep 2: Determine if 131071 can be written as the product of a real number and i. Since 131071 is a Mersenne prime, it is a prime number and not a composite number. Therefore, it cannot be written as the product of a real number and i.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion. Based on the above steps, we can conclude that 131071 is not an imaginary number. Therefore, the statement \"131071 is imaginary\" is false."

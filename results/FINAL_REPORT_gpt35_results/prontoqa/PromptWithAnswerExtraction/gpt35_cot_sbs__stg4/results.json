Every natural number is an integer. 7 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 7 is not imaginary.\n\nSolution: First, let's establish some definitions:\n\n- An imaginary number is a complex number that can be written as a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit \"i\".\n- A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Every Mersenne prime is a prime number. (True)\n   This statement is true by definition. Mersenne primes are a subset of prime numbers.\n\n2. Real numbers are numbers. (True)\n   This statement is true. Real numbers include all rational and irrational numbers.\n\n3. Each prime number is prime. (True)\n   This statement is true by definition. Prime numbers are numbers that are divisible only by 1 and themselves.\n\n4. Prime numbers are natural numbers. (False)\n   This statement is false. Prime numbers can be natural numbers, but they can also be negative or fractions.\n\n5. Every real number is not imaginary. (True)\n   This statement is true. Real numbers can be either real or imaginary, but not both.\n\n6. Every integer is a real number. (True)\n   This statement is true. Integers are a subset of real numbers.\n\n7. Every natural number is not negative. (True)\n   This statement is true. Natural numbers are positive integers.\n\n8. Each Mersenne prime is not composite. (True)\n   This statement is true. Mersenne primes are prime numbers, and by definition, prime numbers are not composite.\n\n9. Every complex number is imaginary. (False)\n   This statement is false. Complex numbers can be either real or imaginary, or a combination of both.\n\n10. Every natural number is an integer. (True)\n    This statement is true. Natural numbers are a subset of integers.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the statement \"7 is not imaginary\" is true."

Every natural number is positive. Each real number is a number. Natural numbers are integers. Mersenne primes are prime numbers. Mersenne primes are prime. Every real number is not imaginary. 127 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 127 is imaginary.\n\nSolution: First, let's determine if 127 is a Mersenne prime. A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. \n\nTo check if 127 is a Mersenne prime, we need to find a positive integer n such that 2^n - 1 equals 127. \n\n2^n - 1 = 127\n\nAdding 1 to both sides:\n\n2^n = 128\n\nSince 2^7 equals 128, we can see that n = 7 satisfies the equation. Therefore, 127 is a Mersenne prime.\n\nNow, let's determine if 127 is imaginary. \n\nAn imaginary number is a number that can be written in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit (\u221a-1).\n\nSince 127 is a real number and does not have an imaginary component (b = 0), we can conclude that 127 is not imaginary.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"127 is imaginary\" is false."

Prime numbers are not composite. Natural numbers are positive. Each Mersenne prime is a prime number. Real numbers are numbers. Mersenne primes are prime. Every prime number is a natural number. 31 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 31 is imaginary.\n\nSolution: First, let's review the definitions:\n\n- Real numbers: Real numbers include all rational and irrational numbers. They are not imaginary.\n- Imaginary numbers: Imaginary numbers are numbers that can be written as a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit \"i\", where \"i\" is defined as the square root of -1.\n- Mersenne primes: Mersenne primes are prime numbers that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer.\n- Prime numbers: Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n- Natural numbers: Natural numbers are positive integers (including zero).\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Real numbers are not imaginary. (True)\n2. Integers are real numbers. (True)\n3. Complex numbers are imaginary. (True)\n4. Each natural number is an integer. (True)\n5. Prime numbers are not composite. (True)\n6. Natural numbers are positive. (True)\n7. Each Mersenne prime is a prime number. (True)\n8. Real numbers are numbers. (True)\n9. Mersenne primes are prime. (True)\n10. Every prime number is a natural number. (True)\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that 31 is a prime number, a natural number, and a Mersenne prime. However, it is not imaginary. Therefore, the statement \"31 is imaginary\" is false."

Mersenne primes are prime: This statement is true. Mersenne primes are a special type of prime numbers that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. Mersenne primes are indeed prime numbers.\n\n2. Prime numbers are not composite: This statement is true. By definition, prime numbers are not composite, meaning they cannot be divided evenly by any other positive integer other than 1 and themselves.\n\n3. Mersenne primes are prime numbers: This statement is redundant, as it is already stated in the first statement. Therefore, it is true.\n\n4. Each real number is a number: This statement is true. Real numbers include all rational and irrational numbers, and they are indeed numbers.\n\n5. Prime numbers are natural numbers: This statement is true. By definition, prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1, which are also considered natural numbers.\n\n6. Real numbers are not imaginary: This statement is true. Real numbers include all rational and irrational numbers, and they are not considered imaginary.\n\n7. Natural numbers are integers: This statement is true. Natural numbers are positive integers, including zero.\n\n8. Complex numbers are imaginary: This statement is true. Complex numbers include both real and imaginary parts, and the imaginary part is represented by a real number multiplied by \"i\".\n\n9. Natural numbers are positive: This statement is true. Natural numbers are positive integers, including zero.\n\n10. Integers are real numbers: This statement is true. Integers include all positive and negative whole numbers, including zero, and they are considered real numbers.\n\n11. 3 is a prime number: This statement is true.

Invertebrates are animals. Each lepidopteran is an insect. Each animal is not unicellular. Each nematode is not segmented. Arthropods are invertebrates. Max is a butterfly.\nTrue or false: Max is segmented.\n\nSolution: First, we know that every insect is an arthropod, and insects are six-legged.

Every natural number is an integer. 127 is a natural number.\nTrue or false: 127 is not imaginary.\n\nSolution: First, let's establish some definitions:\n\n- Prime numbers: Natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n- Composite numbers: Natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime.\n- Mersenne primes: Prime numbers that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer.\n- Natural numbers: Positive integers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)\n- Real numbers: Numbers that can be represented on the number line, including both rational and irrational numbers.\n- Imaginary numbers: Numbers that can be written in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit (\u221a-1).\n- Complex numbers: Numbers that can be written in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit (\u221a-1).\n\nNow let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Prime numbers are not composite. (True)\n   This is true by definition. A number cannot be both prime and composite.\n\n2. Every Mersenne prime is a prime number. (True)\n   This is also true by definition. Mersenne primes are defined as prime numbers.\n\n3. Prime numbers are natural numbers. (True)\n   This is true by definition. Prime numbers are a subset of natural numbers.\n\n4. Real numbers are numbers. (True)\n   This is true by definition. Real numbers include all numbers that can be represented on the number line.\n\n5. Natural numbers are positive. (True)\n   This is true by definition. Natural numbers are positive integers.\n\n6. Each integer is a real number. (True)\n   This is true by definition. Integers are a subset of real numbers.\n\n7. Each real number is not imaginary. (True)\n   This is true by definition. Real numbers do not have an imaginary component.\n\n8. Every Mersenne prime is not composite. (True)\n   This is true by definition. Mersenne primes are defined as prime numbers.\n\n9. Each complex number is imaginary. (False)\n   This is false. Complex numbers can have both real and imaginary components.\n\n10. Every natural number is an integer. (True)\n    This is true by definition. Natural numbers are a subset of integers.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that the statement \"127 is not imaginary\" is true."

Each snake is not furry. Each feline is a carnivore. Cats are felines. Mammals are furry. Each carnivore is carnivorous. Wren is a feline.\nTrue or false: Wren is not furry.\n\n: Validation of prior incorrect solution: Step 1: The step correctly identifies the relevant statements and provides a clear overview of the information given. It contributes towards achieving the goal of determining whether Wren is furry or not.\n\nStep 2: The logical implications drawn in this step are correct. However, the step does not contribute towards achieving the goal of determining whether Wren is furry or not. It only provides a logical analysis of the given statements.\n\nConclusion: The solution is partially correct. While the logical implications are accurate, the solution does not directly address the question of whether Wren is furry or not. Therefore, the solution does not fully achieve the goal.\n\nAnswer: Step 1: Identify the relevant statements:\n- Mammals are vertebrates.\n- Every carnivore is a mammal.\n- Vertebrates are animals.\n- Animals are multicellular.\n- Each snake is not furry.\n- Each feline is a carnivore.\n- Cats are felines.\n- Mammals are furry.\n- Each carnivore is carnivorous.\n- Wren is a feline.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the statements:\n- Mammals are vertebrates, so Wren, being a mammal, is also a vertebrate.\n- Every carnivore is a mammal, so Wren, being a carnivore, is also a mammal.\n- Vertebrates are animals, so Wren, being a vertebrate, is also an animal.\n- Animals are multicellular, so Wren, being an animal, is multicellular.\n- Each snake is not furry, so this statement does not provide any information about Wren.\n- Each feline is a carnivore, so Wren, being a feline, is also a carnivore.\n- Cats are felines, so Wren, being a feline, is also a cat.\n- Mammals are furry, so Wren, being a mammal, is furry.\n- Each carnivore is carnivorous, so Wren, being a carnivore, is carnivorous.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether Wren is furry or not:\nBased on the given statements, it is stated that mammals are furry and Wren is a mammal. Therefore, it can be concluded that Wren is furry.\n\nConclusion: Wren is furry."

Natural numbers are integers. Mersenne primes are not composite. Prime numbers are prime. Prime numbers are natural numbers. Each natural number is positive. Real numbers are numbers. Each real number is not imaginary. 7 is a prime number.\nTrue or false: 7 is imaginary.\n\n: Validation of prior incorrect solution: Step 1: The step is factually incorrect. The given information does not state that every complex number is imaginary. Complex numbers can have both real and imaginary components. The step does not contribute towards achieving the goal.\n\nStep 2: The first part of the step is factually incorrect. The statement \"every complex number is imaginary\" is false, as complex numbers can have both real and imaginary components. The second part of the step is factually correct, as 7 is indeed a prime number. However, the step does not contribute towards achieving the goal, as it does not address the question of whether 7 is imaginary.\n\nConclusion: The solution is incorrect and does not achieve the goal. The analysis of the statements is flawed, and the conclusion that 7 is not imaginary is not supported by the provided information.\n\nAnswer: Step 1: Analyze the given statements:\n- Every complex number is imaginary. (False)\n- Integers are real numbers. (True)\n- Mersenne primes are prime numbers. (True)\n- Natural numbers are integers. (True)\n- Mersenne primes are not composite. (True)\n- Prime numbers are prime. (True)\n- Prime numbers are natural numbers. (True)\n- Each natural number is positive. (True)\n- Real numbers are numbers. (True)\n- Each real number is not imaginary. (True)\n- 7 is a prime number. (True)\n\nStep 2: Determine the truth value of the statement \"7 is imaginary\":\n- From the given statements, we know that every complex number is not imaginary. Therefore, 7, being a complex number, is also not imaginary.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion:\n- The statement \"7 is imaginary\" is false. 7 is not imaginary.\n\nFinal Answer: False. 7 is not imaginary."

Polly is a butterfly.\nTrue or false: Polly is not bony.\n\n: Validation of prior incorrect solution: Step 1: The step correctly identifies the relevant statements and presents them accurately. It contributes towards achieving the goal by providing the necessary information to determine the logical implications.\nStep 2: The step correctly determines the logical implications based on the given statements. It contributes towards achieving the goal by establishing the logical connections between the statements.\nStep 3: The step correctly determines that the statement \"Polly is not bony\" is not directly mentioned in the given statements. However, it incorrectly concludes that Polly is not bony based on the fact that Polly is an insect and arthropod, and arthropods are not bony. This conclusion is not logically valid as it assumes that all insects and arthropods are not bony, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, this step does not contribute towards achieving the goal.\nConclusion: The solution is not correct as the final step incorrectly concludes that Polly is not bony based on incomplete information.

Real numbers are not imaginary. Prime numbers are natural numbers. Prime numbers are prime. Each natural number is positive. Integers are real numbers. Mersenne primes are prime numbers. 31 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 31 is imaginary.\n\n: Validation of prior incorrect solution: Step 1: The step is factually correct as it accurately recalls the given information. However, it does not contribute towards achieving the goal of determining whether 31 is imaginary.\n\nStep 2: The step is factually correct as it accurately describes the properties of Mersenne primes. However, it does not contribute towards achieving the goal of determining whether 31 is imaginary.\n\nStep 3: The step is factually correct as it correctly determines that 31 is not a Mersenne prime. However, it does not contribute towards achieving the goal of determining whether 31 is imaginary.\n\nStep 4: The step is factually correct as it correctly states that not all imaginary numbers are complex. However, it does not contribute towards achieving the goal of determining whether 31 is imaginary.\n\nStep 5: The conclusion is correct as it correctly determines that 31 is not imaginary. However, it does not contribute towards achieving the goal of determining whether 31 is imaginary.\n\nOverall, the solution is factually correct but does not contribute towards achieving the goal of determining whether 31 is imaginary.\n\nAnswer: Step 1: Recall the given information:\n- Natural numbers are integers.\n- Each Mersenne prime is prime.\n- Complex numbers are imaginary.\n- Every real number is a number.\n- Real numbers are not imaginary.\n- Prime numbers are natural numbers.\n- Prime numbers are prime.\n- Each natural number is positive.\n- Integers are real numbers.\n- Mersenne primes are prime numbers.\n- 31 is a Mersenne prime.\n\nStep 2: Determine if 31 is imaginary:\n- Recall that imaginary numbers are numbers that can be written in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit (\u221a-1).\n- Since 31 is a natural number and not a complex number, it cannot be written in the form a + bi.\n- Therefore, 31 is not imaginary.\n\nConclusion: 31 is not imaginary.\n\nNote: The previous mistakes in the validation have been corrected."

Complex numbers are imaginary. Natural numbers are integers. Each real number is a number. Integers are real numbers. Every real number is not imaginary. Mersenne primes are not composite. 131071 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 131071 is imaginary.\n\nAnswer: Step 1: Recall the definition of an imaginary number. An imaginary number is a number that can be written as a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit \"i\", where \"i\" is defined as the square root of -1.\n\nStep 2: Recall the definition of a Mersenne prime. A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a natural number.\n\nStep 3: Recall the given information. It is stated that Mersenne primes are not composite, and 131071 is a Mersenne prime.\n\nStep 4: Determine if 131071 is imaginary. To do this, we need to check if it can be written as a real number multiplied by \"i\".\n\nStep 5: Substitute the value of 131071 into the formula for Mersenne primes: 2^n - 1. We have 2^n - 1 = 131071.\n\nStep 6: Solve for n. Rearrange the equation to isolate n: 2^n = 131072. Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get n = log2(131072).\n\nStep 7: Calculate the value of n. Using a calculator, we find that log2(131072) is equal to 17.\n\nStep 8: Substitute the value of n back into the formula for Mersenne primes: 2^n - 1. We have 2^17 - 1 = 131071.\n\nStep 9: Compare the value of 131071 to the definition of an imaginary number. Since 131071 is not a complex number (a number that can be written as a real number plus an imaginary number), it is not imaginary.\n\nStep 10: Conclusion.

It correctly checks different values of n to determine if 31 can be written in the form 2^n - 1. It contributes towards achieving the goal by determining if 31 is a Mersenne prime.\n\nStep 4: The step is logically and factually correct. It correctly concludes that since 31 is a Mersenne prime and not all Mersenne primes are imaginary, 31 is not imaginary. It contributes towards achieving the goal by determining if 31 is imaginary.\n\nConclusion: The solution is correct and achieves the goal of determining whether 31 is imaginary. The conclusion that \"31 is imaginary\" is false.\n\nAnswer: Step 1: Recall the definition of an imaginary number. An imaginary number is a number that can be written in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, defined as the square root of -1.\n\nStep 2: Recall the definition of a Mersenne prime. A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer.\n\nStep 3: Check if 31 can be written in the form 2^n - 1. Start with n = 1 and increment n until 2^n - 1 is greater than or equal to 31. \n\n2^1 - 1 = 1, which is less than 31.\n2^2 - 1 = 3, which is less than 31.\n2^3 - 1 = 7, which is less than 31.\n2^4 - 1 = 15, which is less than 31.\n2^5 - 1 = 31, which is equal to 31.\n\nStep 4: Since 31 can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n = 5, it is a Mersenne prime. However, not all Mersenne primes are imaginary. Therefore, we cannot conclude that 31 is imaginary.\n\nConclusion: The conclusion that \"31 is imaginary\" is false."

Mersenne primes are not composite. 8191 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 8191 is not real.\n\nProposed solution 1: Step 1: Determine the definition of a real number.\nA real number is a number that can be represented on the number line. It includes both rational numbers (numbers that can be expressed as a fraction) and irrational numbers (numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction).\n\nStep 2: Determine the definition of a Mersenne prime.\nA Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a natural number.\n\nStep 3: Determine if 8191 is a Mersenne prime.\n8191 is a prime number and can be written as 2^13 - 1.

Mersenne primes are prime numbers. 8191 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 8191 is real.\n\nProposed solution 1: Step 1: Understand the problem.\nThe problem is asking whether 8191 is a real number.\n\nStep 2: Recall the definition of real numbers.\nReal numbers are numbers that can be represented on the number line, including both rational and irrational numbers.\n\nStep 3: Recall the definition of Mersenne primes.\nMersenne primes are prime numbers that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer.\n\nStep 4: Determine if 8191 is a Mersenne prime.\nTo determine if 8191 is a Mersenne prime, we need to check if it can be written in the form 2^n - 1. \n\nStep 5: Calculate 2^n - 1.\nTo calculate 2^n - 1, we need to find the value of n that satisfies the equation 2^n - 1 = 8191.\n\nStep 6: Solve the equation 2^n - 1 = 8191.\nTo solve the equation, we can start by adding 1 to both sides: 2^n = 8192.\n\nStep 7: Determine the value of n.\nTo find the value of n, we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides: log2(2^n) = log2(8192).\n\nStep 8: Simplify the equation.\nThe logarithm base 2 of 2^n is simply n, so the equation becomes: n = log2(8192).\n\nStep 9: Calculate the value of n.\nUsing a calculator, we can find that log2(8192) is equal to 13.\n\nStep 10: Determine if 8191 is a Mersenne prime.\nSince we have found that n = 13 satisfies the equation 2^n - 1 = 8191, we can conclude that 8191 is a Mersenne prime.\n\nStep 11: Determine if 8191 is real.\nSince 8191 is a Mersenne prime, and Mersenne primes are a subset of prime numbers, which are a subset of natural numbers, and natural numbers are a subset of integers, and integers are a subset of real numbers, we can conclude that 8191 is indeed a real number.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"8191 is real\" is true.\nAnswer 1: true"

Polly is a cat.\nTrue or false: Polly is herbivorous.\n\nProposed solution 1: Step 1: Identify the relevant information:\n- Felines are carnivores.\n- Sheep are herbivorous.\n- Animals are multicellular.\n- Cats are felines.\n- Every mammal is warm-blooded.\n- Every vertebrate is an animal.\n- Each carnivore is not herbivorous.\n- Carnivores are mammals.\n- Mammals are vertebrates.\n- Polly is a cat.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the statements:\n- Felines are carnivores: This means that all felines, including cats, are carnivorous.\n- Sheep are herbivorous: This means that sheep only eat plants and are not carnivorous.\n- Animals are multicellular: This is a general statement about animals and does not provide specific information about cats or sheep.\n- Cats are felines: This means that cats fall under the category of felines and are therefore carnivorous.\n- Every mammal is warm-blooded: This means that all mammals, including cats, are warm-blooded.\n- Every vertebrate is an animal: This means that all vertebrates, including mammals, are animals.\n- Each carnivore is not herbivorous: This means that carnivores, including cats, do not eat plants.\n- Carnivores are mammals: This means that all carnivores, including cats, are mammals.\n- Mammals are vertebrates: This means that all mammals, including cats, are vertebrates.\n- Polly is a cat: This statement provides specific information about Polly, stating that she is a cat.\n\nStep 3: Determine the answer:\nBased on the given information, we know that felines (including cats) are carnivores and do not eat plants. Therefore, the statement \"Polly is herbivorous\" is false.\n\nAnswer: False. Polly is not herbivorous.\nAnswer 1: false"

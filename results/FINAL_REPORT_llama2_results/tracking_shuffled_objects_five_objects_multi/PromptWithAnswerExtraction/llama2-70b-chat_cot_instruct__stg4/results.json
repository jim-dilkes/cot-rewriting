Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Initially, the players have the following balls:\n\t* Alice: Yellow\n\t* Bob: Blue\n\t* Claire: Pink\n\t* Dave: White\n\t* Eve: Red\n2. Claire and Alice swap balls, so now we have:\n\t* Alice: Pink\n\t* Bob: Blue\n\t* Claire: Yellow\n\t* Dave: White\n\t* Eve: Red\n3. Eve and Bob swap balls, so now we have:\n\t* Alice: Pink\n\t* Bob: Red\n\t* Claire: Yellow\n\t* Dave: White\n\t* Eve: Blue\n4. Bob and Dave swap balls, so now we have:\n\t* Alice: Pink\n\t* Bob: White\n\t* Claire: Yellow\n\t* Dave: Red\n\t* Eve: Blue\n5. Claire and Eve swap balls, so now we have:\n\t* Alice: Pink\n\t* Bob: White\n\t* Claire: Blue\n\t* Dave: Red\n\t* Eve: Yellow\n6. Finally, Alice and Dave swap balls, so now we have:\n\t* Alice: Red\n\t* Bob: White\n\t* Claire: Blue\n\t* Dave: Pink\n\t* Eve: Yellow\n\nTherefore, the final answer is (E) Alice has the red ball."

Dave and Eve trade positions:\n\t* Dave: goalkeeper\n\t* Eve: left midfielder\n5. Bob and Dave trade positions:\n\t* Bob: goalkeeper\n\t* Dave: fullback\n6. Alice and Claire trade positions:\n\t* Alice: center midfielder\n\t* Claire: fullback\n\nNow, let's examine the final positions:\n\n1. Dave: goalkeeper (from step 4)\n2. Alice: center midfielder (from step 6)\n3. Bob: fullback (from step 5)\n4. Claire: fullback (from step 6)\n5. Eve: left midfielder (from step 4)\n\nTherefore, the final positions are:\n\nA) Dave: goalkeeper\nB) Alice: center midfielder\nC) Bob: fullback\nD) Claire: fullback\nE) Eve: left midfielder\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nE) Eve: left midfielder"

Let's break down the steps of the white elephant gift exchange to solve the problem:\n\nStep 1: Bob and Claire swap gifts.\n\n* Bob gives his black ball to Claire.\n* Claire gives her white present to Bob.\n\nStep 2: Eve and Bob swap gifts.\n\n* Eve gives her brown present to Bob.\n* Bob gives his black ball to Eve.\n\nStep 3: Eve and Alice swap gifts.\n\n* Eve gives her brown present to Alice.\n* Alice gives her orange ball to Eve.\n\nStep 4: Dave and Alice swap gifts.\n\n* Dave gives his yellow present to Alice.\n* Alice gives her orange ball to Dave.\n\nStep 5: Claire and Dave swap gifts.\n\n* Claire gives her white present to Dave.\n* Dave gives his yellow present to Claire.\n\nNow, let's examine the final state of the gifts:\n\n* Eve has the orange ball (from Alice).\n* Bob has the brown present (from Eve).\n* Claire has the yellow present (from Dave).\n* Dave has the white present (from Claire).\n* Alice has the black ball (from Bob).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nE) Eve has the orange ball."

Alice and Bob swap gifts, so Alice now has the brown present and Bob has the green present.\n2. Bob and Eve swap gifts, so Bob now has the white present and Eve has the purple present.\n3. Dave and Eve swap gifts, so Dave now has the blue present and Eve has the white present.\n4. Alice and Claire swap gifts, so Alice now has the purple present and Claire has the green present.\n5.

Claire and Bob swap books.\n\n| Friend | Initial Book | Final Book |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Alice | Moby Dick | ? |\n| Bob | Ulysses | The Fellowship of the Ring |\n| Claire | The Fellowship of the Ring | Ulysses |\n| Dave | Lolita | ? |\n| Eve | Catch-22 | ? |\n\n2. Claire and Dave swap books.\n\n| Friend | Initial Book | Final Book |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Alice | Moby Dick | ? |\n| Bob | Ulysses | The Fellowship of the Ring |\n| Claire | Lolita | The Fellowship of the Ring |\n| Dave | The Fellowship of the Ring | Lolita |\n| Eve | Catch-22 | ? |\n\n3.

At the start of the event, they are each holding a present of a different color: Alice has a red present, Bob has a pink ball, Claire has a black ball, Dave has a brown present, and Eve has a purple present. \n\nAs the event progresses, pairs of people swap gifts. First, Claire and Dave swap their gifts. Then, Eve and Dave swap their gifts. Then, Eve and Claire swap their gifts. Then, Dave and Bob swap their gifts. Finally, Alice and Claire swap their gifts. At the end of the event, Claire has the \n\nA) red present.\nB) pink ball.\nC) black ball.\nD) brown present.\nE) purple present.[/INST]  The correct answer is (E) purple present.\n\nHere's how the swaps occur:\n\n1. Claire and Dave swap gifts, so Claire now has the brown present and Dave has the black ball.\n2. Eve and Dave swap gifts, so Eve now has the black ball and Dave has the purple present.\n3. Eve and Claire swap gifts, so Eve now has the brown present and Claire has the purple present.\n4. Dave and Bob swap gifts, so Dave now has the pink ball and Bob has the red present.\n5. Alice and Claire swap gifts, so Alice now has the purple present and Claire has the red present.\n\nTherefore, at the end of the event, Claire has the red present, and the final gift distribution is:\n\n* Alice: purple present\n* Bob: pink ball\n* Claire: red present\n* Dave: black ball\n* Eve: brown present"

Each real number is not imaginary. Prime numbers are natural numbers. Natural numbers are integers. 127 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 127 is not imaginary.[/INST]  True.\n\nThe statement \"127 is not imaginary\" is true because 127 is a real number and not an imaginary number. Imaginary numbers are defined as numbers that can be expressed in the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit, which satisfies $i^2 = -1$. Since 127 is a real number and not of the form $a + bi$, it is not imaginary."

Insects are not eight-legged. Arthropods are invertebrates. Sam is a butterfly.\nTrue or false: Sam is eight-legged.[/INST]  False.\n\nAccording to the given information, every lepidopteran is an insect, and Sam is a butterfly, which means Sam is a lepidopteran. It is also stated that insects are not eight-legged, and spiders are eight-legged. Therefore, it can be concluded that Sam, being a lepidopteran and not a spider, is not eight-legged."

Every butterfly is a lepidopteran. Insects are arthropods. Lepidopterans are insects. Each whale is bony. Sally is a painted lady.\nTrue or false: Sally is bony.\n\nSolve this problem using a step-by-step approach.[/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the statements and use a step-by-step approach to determine whether Sally is bony or not:\n1. \"Each arthropod is not bony.\" - This statement is true, since arthropods can have exoskeletons made of various materials, including chitin, which is not bony.\n2. \"Each arthropod is a protostome.\" - This statement is true, since all arthropods belong to the subphylum Protostomia.\n3. \"Each protostome is an invertebrate.\" - This statement is true, since all protostomes are invertebrates.\n4. \"Invertebrates are animals.\" - This statement is true, since invertebrates are a category of animals that do not have a backbone or spinal column.\n5. \"Every painted lady is a butterfly.\" - This statement is false, since a painted lady is actually a type of butterfly, but not all butterflies are painted ladies.\n6. \"Every insect is not eight-legged.\" - This statement is false, since some insects, such as spiders and crustaceans, have more than eight legs.\n7. \"Every butterfly is a lepidopteran.\" - This statement is true, since all butterflies belong to the order Lepidoptera.\n8. \"Insects are arthropods.\" - This statement is true, since insects are a subcategory of arthropods.\n9. \"Lepidopterans are insects.\" - This statement is true, since lepidopterans are a type of insect.\n10. \"Each whale is bony.\" - This statement is false, since whales are marine mammals that do not have bones.\n\nNow, let's apply these statements to Sally:\n1. Since Sally is a painted lady, she is a butterfly (true).\n2. Since Sally is a butterfly, she is an insect (true).\n3. Since Sally is an insect, she is an arthropod (true).\n4. Since Sally is an arthropod, she may or may not be bony (dependent on the previous statements).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot conclude whether Sally is bony or not."

Therefore, 3 is not imaginary.\nSo, the statement \"3 is not imaginary\" is TRUE.\nStep 3: Check if other statements in the statement are true or false\nLet's check each statement separately:\nStatement 1: Each natural number is an integer.\nTRUE. Every natural number is indeed an integer.\nStatement 2: Real numbers are not imaginary.\nTRUE. Real numbers are not of the form a + bi, since they cannot be expressed as complex numbers.\nStatement 3: Mersenne primes are prime numbers.\nTRUE. Mersenne primes are indeed prime numbers.\nStatement 4: Prime numbers are prime.\nTRUE. Every prime number is indeed prime.\nStatement 5: Every prime number is a natural number.\nFALSE. Not every prime number is a natural number. For example, the prime number 7 is not a natural number.\nStatement 6: Every real number is a number.\nTRUE. Every real number is indeed a number.\nStatement 7: Every integer is a real number.\nFALSE. Not every integer is a real number. For example, the integer -5 is not a real number.\nStep 4: Conclude whether the statement is true or false\nSince we have found that at least one statement in the statement is true, the statement must be true overall.\nTherefore, the statement \"3 is not imaginary\" is TRUE.",

(Spiders are a type of arthropod, and every spider has eight legs.)\n\nStep 3: Use the conclusions to answer the question:\nQuestion: Is Rex eight-legged?\nAnswer: No, Rex is not eight-legged because it is not a spider. (Conclusion 2)\nTherefore, the statement \"Rex is not eight-legged\" is true."

Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: Define the terms used in the statement\n* Mersenne prime: a prime number of the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number\n* Prime number: a positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1\n* Natural number: a positive integer greater than 1\n* Real number: a number that can be represented on the number line\n* Complex number: a number of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, which satisfies i^2 = -1\nStep 2: Check if the statement is true or false\nThe statement says \"31 is imaginary.\" To determine whether this is true or false, we need to check if 31 is a complex number.\nA complex number is a number of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, which satisfies i^2 = -1.\nLet's check if 31 can be written in this form:\n31 = 31 + 0i\nSince 31 cannot be written in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, the statement \"31 is imaginary\" is false.\nTherefore, the answer is:\nFalse."

Integers are not real numbers because they do not have decimal expansions.\n* Statement 5: \"Imaginary numbers are not real.\" - True.\n* Statement 6: \"Every real number is real.\" - True.\n* Statement 7: \"7 is a Mersenne prime.\" - True.\nStep 3: Use the given statements to deduce new facts\n* From statement 1 and statement 7, we know that 7 is a prime number.\nStep 4: Conclude whether the original statement is true or false\nSince statement 8 states that 7 is real, and we have already determined that 7 is a prime number and a Mersenne prime, it must be true that 7 is real. Therefore, the original statement is true.\nConclusion: The original statement is true, and 7 is indeed a real number.",

(True)\n* Insects are six-legged. (True)\n* Insects are arthropods. (True)\n* Each arthropod is an invertebrate. (True)\n\nStep 2: Apply the given statements to the conclusion:\nSam is a lepidopteran.\n\nFrom the given statements, we know that lepidopterans are insects. Since Sam is a lepidopteran, he must be an insect.\nSo, the conclusion \"Sam is not bony\" is False.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nTrue."

Every prime number is a natural number. 3 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 3 is not imaginary.\n\nSolve this problem using a step-by-step approach.[/INST]  Great! Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: Check if the statement is true for the given value of 3.\nSince 3 is a Mersenne prime, we know that it is a real number. Therefore, the statement \"3 is not imaginary\" is TRUE.\nStep 2: Use mathematical induction to prove the statement for all positive integers n greater than 1.\nAssume that the statement is TRUE for some integer k. That is, for any positive integer k greater than 1, the statement \"k is not imaginary\" is TRUE.\nNow, consider the next integer k+1. By the assumption made in Step 2, we know that k+1 is also a real number. Therefore, the statement \"k+1 is not imaginary\" is also TRUE.\nStep 3: Conclude that the statement is TRUE for all positive integers.\nSince the statement is TRUE for k=1 (which is a positive integer), and it is also TRUE for k+1 (which is also a positive integer), we can conclude that the statement is TRUE for all positive integers n greater than 1.\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nTRUE."

(Given)\n* Vertebrates are animals. (Given)\n* Animals are multicellular. (Given)\n\nStep 2: Use the given statements to find out if Polly is warm-blooded\nPolly is a feline, which means she is a carnivore. Since every carnivore is carnivorous, Polly must be carnivorous.\nNext, we need to determine if Polly is warm-blooded. Unfortunately, none of the given statements mention whether Polly is warm-blooded or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Polly is warm-blooded or not based on the given information.\nSo, the answer to the question \"True or false: Polly is warm-blooded?\" is False. We cannot determine whether Polly is warm-blooded based on the given information."

Prime numbers are natural numbers. Prime numbers are not composite. Every real number is a number. 31 is a prime number.\nTrue or false: 31 is not real.\n\nSolve this problem using a step-by-step approach.[/INST]  Great! Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: Define the terms used in the problem\n* Mersenne prime: A prime number of the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number.\n* Natural number: A positive integer greater than 0.\n* Real number: A number that can be represented on the number line.\n* Composite number: A number that can be expressed as the product of smaller positive integers.\n* Prime number: A number that is divisible only by itself and 1.\n\nStep 2: Check if the statement is true or false\nThe statement \"31 is not real\" implies that 31 is not a real number. However, we know that 31 is indeed a real number, since it can be represented on the number line. Therefore, the statement is False.\n\nStep 3: Conclude the solution\nSince the statement is False, we have proven that 31 is both a real number and a prime number. Therefore, the statements \"Mersenne primes are not composite\" and \"Prime numbers are natural numbers\" are also True.\n\nSo, the final conclusion is:\nTrue: 31 is a prime number.\nFalse: 31 is not real.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to approach and solve problems like this! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."

Let's use a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:\nStep 1: Identify the given statements and simplify them:\n1. Every whale is bony. (False)\n2. Each insect is six-legged. (True)\n3. Painted ladies are butterflies. (True)\n4. Arthropods are protostomes. (True)\n5. Every protostome is an invertebrate. (True)\n6. Each lepidopteran is an insect. (True)\n7. Each butterfly is a lepidopteran. (True)\n8. Every arthropod is not bony. (True)\n9. Invertebrates are animals. (True)\n10. Insects are arthropods. (True)\n11. Each animal is not unicellular. (True)\n\nNow, let's apply these simplified statements to determine whether Sam is bony or not:\nStep 2: Apply the statements to Sam:\nSam is a painted lady, which means he is a butterfly. (From statement 3)\nSince butterflies are arthropods, they are not bony. (From statement 8)\nTherefore, Sam is not bony.\nSo, the answer to the question \"Is Sam bony?\" is False."

Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: Check if the statement is true or false.\nThe statement \"31 is not negative\" can be rewritten as \"31 > 0\".\nSo, the question becomes: Is 31 greater than 0?\nAnswer: Yes, 31 is indeed greater than 0, so the statement is TRUE.\nTherefore, we have confirmed that the statement \"31 is not negative\" is TRUE.\nStep 2: Now, let's check if the statement \"Every integer is a real number\" is TRUE or FALSE.\nAn integer is defined as a whole number, either positive, negative, or zero. A real number, on the other hand, is a number that can be represented on the number line.\nSince integers can be represented on the number line, they are also real numbers. Therefore, the statement \"Every integer is a real number\" is TRUE.\nStep 3: Next, let's check if the statement \"Each Mersenne prime is not composite\" is TRUE or FALSE.\nA Mersenne prime is a prime number of the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. By definition, a composite number is a number that can be expressed as the product of two or more smaller numbers.\nSince a Mersenne prime cannot be expressed as the product of smaller numbers, it is not composite. Therefore, the statement \"Each Mersenne prime is not composite\" is TRUE.\nStep 4: Now, let's check if the statement \"Each prime number is a natural number\" is TRUE or FALSE.\nA prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1. A natural number, on the other hand, is any positive integer.\nSince prime numbers are a subset of natural numbers, the statement \"Each prime number is a natural number\" is TRUE.\nStep 5: Let's check if the statement \"Mersenne primes are prime numbers\" is TRUE or FALSE.\nBy definition, a Mersenne prime is a prime number of the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. Since a Mersenne prime is a prime number, the statement \"Mersenne primes are prime numbers\" is TRUE.\nStep 6: Finally, let's check if the statement \"Negative numbers are negative\" is TRUE or FALSE.\nThis statement is simply a tautology, as negative numbers are indeed always negative.

So, the first statement is true.\n2. \"Animals are multicellular.\"\nTrue. This statement is a basic biological fact, and it applies to all living organisms, including animals. Therefore, the second statement is true.\n3. \"Each protostome is an invertebrate.\"\nTrue. Protostomes are a group of animals that include invertebrates, such as insects, crustaceans, and mollusks. Since wren is not an insect (as we established in statement 1), it is a protostome and therefore an invertebrate. So, the third statement is true.\n4. \"Butterflies are lepidopterans.\"\nTrue. Lepidoptera is a specific order of insects that includes butterflies and moths. Since wren is not an insect (as we established in statement 1), it cannot be a butterfly or a moth, and therefore the fourth statement is true.\n5. \"Insects are not eight-legged.\"\nFalse. Many insects have six legs, while some species have more than eight legs. For example, spiders have eight legs, and centipedes have many more than eight legs. Therefore, the fifth statement is false.\n6. \"Every lepidopteran is an insect.\"\nTrue. As we established earlier, lepidopterans are a type of insect. Therefore, every lepidopteran is indeed an insect. So, the sixth statement is true.\n7. \"Invertebrates are animals.\"\nTrue. Invertebrates are a group of animals that do not have a backbone or internal skeleton. Since wren is not an insect (as we established in statement 1), it is an invertebrate animal. Therefore, the seventh statement is true.\n8. \"Arthropods are protostomes.\"\nTrue. Arthropods are a group of animals that include protostomes, such as insects, crustaceans, and mollusks. Since wren is not an insect (as we established in statement 1), it is an arthropod and a protostome. Therefore, the eighth statement is true.\n9. \"Whales are bony.\"\nFalse. Whales are actually mammals, which means they have bones, but they are not bony. Therefore, the ninth statement is false.\n10. \"Insects are arthropods.\"\nTrue. As we established earlier, insects are a type of arthropod.

Since wren is not an insect (as we established in statement 1), it is a protostome and therefore an invertebrate. So, the third statement is true.\n4. \"Butterflies are lepidopterans.\"\nTrue. Lepidoptera is a specific order of insects that includes butterflies and moths. Since wren is not an insect (as we established in statement 1), it cannot be a butterfly or a moth, and therefore the fourth statement is true.\n5. \"Insects are not eight-legged.\"\nFalse. Many insects have six legs, while some species have more than eight legs. For example, spiders have eight legs, and centipedes have many more than eight legs. Therefore, the fifth statement is false.\n6. \"Every lepidopteran is an insect.\"\nTrue. As we established earlier, lepidopterans are a type of insect. Therefore, every lepidopteran is indeed an insect. So, the sixth statement is true.\n7. \"Invertebrates are animals.\"\nTrue. Invertebrates are a group of animals that do not have a backbone or internal skeleton. Since wren is not an insect (as we established in statement 1), it is an invertebrate animal. Therefore, the seventh statement is true.\n8. \"Arthropods are protostomes.\"\nTrue. Arthropods are a group of animals that include protostomes, such as insects, crustaceans, and mollusks. Since wren is not an insect (as we established in statement 1), it is an arthropod and a protostome. Therefore, the eighth statement is true.\n9. \"Whales are bony.\"\nFalse. Whales are actually mammals, which means they have bones, but they are not bony. Therefore, the ninth statement is false.\n10. \"Insects are arthropods.\"\nTrue. As we established earlier, insects are a type of arthropod. Therefore, the tenth statement is true.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that:\nWren is not bony (true).\nWren is a protostome (true).\nWren is not an insect (true).\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nTrue.",

Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: Define the terms used in the statement\n* Prime number: A positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1.\n* Natural number: A positive integer greater than 0.\n* Integer: A whole number, either positive, negative, or zero.\n* Real number: A number that can be represented on the number line.\n* Complex number: A number of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, which satisfies i^2 = -1.\nStep 2: Check if the statement is true for the first statement\n* Every prime number is not composite. (True)\nStep 3: Check if the statement is true for the second statement\n* Each prime number is a natural number. (True)\nStep 4: Check if the statement is true for the third statement\n* Every natural number is an integer. (True)\nStep 5: Check if the statement is true for the fourth statement\n* Real numbers are numbers. (True)\nStep 6: Check if the statement is true for the fifth statement\n* Each Mersenne prime is prime. (True)\nStep 7: Check if the statement is true for the sixth statement\n* 127 is a Mersenne prime. (True)\nStep 8: Check if the statement is true for the seventh statement\n* 127 is not imaginary. (False)\nExplanation:\nThe statement \"127 is not imaginary\" is false because 127 is a complex number, and it can be written as 127 + 127i, where i is the imaginary unit. Therefore, 127 is imaginary.\nConclusion:\nThe statement is partially true. The first six statements are true, but the seventh statement is false.",

Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: Define the terms\nLet's define the terms used in the statement:\n* Real number: a number that can be represented on the number line\n* Imaginary number: a number that can be expressed as a multiple of the imaginary unit i, where i = \u221a(-1)\n* Integer: a whole number, either positive, negative, or zero\n* Natural number: a positive integer, including zero\n* Prime number: a positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1\n* Mersenne prime: a prime number that is one less than a power of two (i.e., 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number)\nStep 2: Identify the given statements\nThe statement provides us with several claims about real numbers, imaginary numbers, integers, natural numbers, prime numbers, and Mersenne primes:\n1. Every real number is real.\n2. Every imaginary number is not real.\n3. Integers are real numbers.\n4. Each natural number is an integer.\n5. Real numbers are numbers.\n6. Each Mersenne prime is prime.\n7. Every Mersenne prime is a prime number.\n8. Every natural number is not negative.\n9. Prime numbers are natural numbers.\n10. Each prime number is not composite.\nStep 3: Evaluate each claim\nLet's evaluate each claim provided in the statement:\nClaim 1: Every real number is real.\nTrue. A real number is any number that can be represented on the number line, and all real numbers are indeed real.\nClaim 2: Every imaginary number is not real.\nTrue. An imaginary number is a number that can be expressed as a multiple of the imaginary unit i, and since i is not a real number, imaginary numbers are not real.\nClaim 3: Integers are real numbers.\nTrue. Integers are whole numbers, and since they can be represented on the number line, they are real numbers.\nClaim 4: Each natural number is an integer.\nTrue. Natural numbers are positive integers, and since they are whole numbers, they are indeed integers.\nClaim 5: Real numbers are numbers.\nTrue. Any number that can be represented on the number line is a real number.\nClaim 6: Each Mersenne prime is prime.\nTrue. A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two, and since it is divisible only by itself and 1, it is indeed prime.\nClaim 7: Every Mersenne prime is a prime number.\nTrue. Since every Mersanne prime is prime, and prime numbers are defined as positive integers that are divisible only by themselves and 1, then every Mersenne prime is indeed a prime number.\nClaim 8: Every natural number is not negative.\nTrue. Natural numbers are positive integers, and since they are not negative, this claim is true.\nClaim 9: Prime numbers are natural numbers.\nTrue. Prime numbers are defined as positive integers that are divisible only by themselves and 1, and since natural numbers are also positive integers, then prime numbers are indeed natural numbers.\nClaim 10: Each prime number is not composite.\nTrue. A prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1, and since it is not divisible by any other number except for 1 and itself, it is indeed not composite.\nStep 4: Use the above evaluations to determine the truth value of the final statement\nNow that we have evaluated each claim provided in the statement, let's use those evaluations to determine the truth value of the final statement:\nStatement: 127 is not real.\nIf Claim 1 is true, and Claims 2-10 are true, then 127 is not real.\nExplanation: If 127 is a real number, then it",

Each prime number is not composite.\nStep 3: Evaluate each claim\nLet's evaluate each claim provided in the statement:\nClaim 1: Every real number is real.\nTrue. A real number is any number that can be represented on the number line, and all real numbers are indeed real.\nClaim 2: Every imaginary number is not real.\nTrue. An imaginary number is a number that can be expressed as a multiple of the imaginary unit i, and since i is not a real number, imaginary numbers are not real.\nClaim 3: Integers are real numbers.\nTrue. Integers are whole numbers, and since they can be represented on the number line, they are real numbers.\nClaim 4: Each natural number is an integer.\nTrue. Natural numbers are positive integers, and since they are whole numbers, they are indeed integers.\nClaim 5: Real numbers are numbers.\nTrue. Any number that can be represented on the number line is a real number.\nClaim 6: Each Mersenne prime is prime.\nTrue. A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two, and since it is divisible only by itself and 1, it is indeed prime.\nClaim 7: Every Mersenne prime is a prime number.\nTrue. Since every Mersanne prime is prime, and prime numbers are defined as positive integers that are divisible only by themselves and 1, then every Mersenne prime is indeed a prime number.\nClaim 8: Every natural number is not negative.\nTrue. Natural numbers are positive integers, and since they are not negative, this claim is true.\nClaim 9: Prime numbers are natural numbers.\nTrue. Prime numbers are defined as positive integers that are divisible only by themselves and 1, and since natural numbers are also positive integers, then prime numbers are indeed natural numbers.\nClaim 10: Each prime number is not composite.\nTrue. A prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1, and since it is not divisible by any other number except for 1 and itself, it is indeed not composite.\nStep 4: Use the above evaluations to determine the truth value of the final statement\nNow that we have evaluated each claim provided in the statement, let's use those evaluations to determine the truth value of the final statement:\nStatement: 127 is not real.\nIf Claim 1 is true, and Claims 2-10 are true, then 127 is not real.\nExplanation: If 127 is a real number, then it",

Real numbers are not imaginary. Prime numbers are natural numbers. Prime numbers are prime. Each natural number is positive. Integers are real numbers. Mersenne primes are prime numbers. 31 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 31 is imaginary.\n\nAnswer: <<SYS>>\nYou are an instruction following, problem solving assistant.\n<</SYS>>\n\n[INST]Natural numbers are integers. Each Mersenne prime is prime. Complex numbers are imaginary. Every real number is a number. Real numbers are not imaginary. Prime numbers are natural numbers. Prime numbers are prime. Each natural number is positive. Integers are real numbers. Mersenne primes are prime numbers. 31 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 31 is imaginary.\n\nSolve this problem using a step-by-step approach.[/INST]  Great! Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: Define the terms used in the statement\n* Natural numbers: Positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...).\n* Integers: Whole numbers (...,-1, -2, -3, ...).\n* Real numbers: Numbers that can be represented on the number line (including fractions and decimals).\n* Imaginary numbers: Numbers that can be expressed as a multiple of the imaginary unit i, where i = \u221a(-1) (e.g., i = 2i, 3i, 4i, ...).\n* Prime numbers: Numbers that are divisible only by themselves and 1 (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...).\nStep 2: Check if the statement is true for the first statement:\n31 is a Mersenne prime.\nSince 31 is a Mersenne prime, it is prime. Therefore, the statement is true for this case.\nStep 3: Check if the statement is true for the second statement:\n31 is imaginary.\nSince 31 is not equal to 0, it is not imaginary. Therefore, the statement is false for this case.\nStep 4: Conclude whether the statement is true or false based on the results from Steps 1-3:\nThe statement is false.\nExplanation:\nFrom Step 2, we know that 31 is a Mersenne prime, which means it is prime. However, from Step 3, we know that 31 is not imaginary, which means it is real. Therefore, the statement that every real number is a number is false.\nSo, the statement \"Every real number is a number\" is false."

Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: Define the terms used in the statement\n* Prime number: A positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1.\n* Natural number: A positive integer greater than 0.\n* Real number: A number that can be represented on the number line.\n* Complex number: A number of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, which satisfies i^2 = -1.\n* Mersenne prime: A prime number of the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number.\nStep 2: Check if the statement is true for the first statement\n* Statement: Each prime number is not composite.\n* Proof: Let p be a prime number. If p is composite, then there exists an integer n such that p = nx, where x is not equal to 1. However, since p is prime, it cannot be divided by any integer except for 1 and itself, so n must be 1 or p. Therefore, p is not composite. Hence, the statement is true.\nStep 3: Check if the statement is true for the second statement\n* Statement: Natural numbers are positive.\n* Proof: Let n be a natural number. By definition, n is a positive integer, so it is positive. Hence, the statement is true.\nStep 4: Check if the statement is true for the third statement\n* Statement: Real numbers are not imaginary.\n* Proof: Imaginary numbers are defined as numbers of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, which satisfies i^2 = -1. Since real numbers are not of this form, they are not imaginary. Hence, the statement is true.\nStep 5: Check if the statement is true for the fourth statement\n* Statement: Prime numbers are natural numbers.\n* Proof: Let p be a prime number. By definition, p is a positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1. Since p is divisible by 1, it is a natural number. Therefore, the statement is true.\nStep 6: Check if the statement is true for the fifth statement\n* Statement: Each Mersenne prime is a prime number.\n* Proof: Let p be a Mersenne prime. By definition, p is of the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. Since p is prime, it satisfies the definition of a prime number. Therefore, p is a prime number. Hence, the statement is true.\nStep 7: Check if the statement is true for the sixth statement\n* Statement: Natural numbers are integers.\n* Proof: Let n be a natural number. By definition, n is a positive integer. Since positive integers are a subset of integers, n is an integer. Hence, the statement is true.\nStep 8: Check if the statement is true for the seventh statement\n* Statement: Every integer is a real number.\n* Proof: Let n be an integer. By definition, n is a whole number. Since whole numbers are a subset of real numbers, n is a real number. Hence, the statement is true.\nStep 9: Check if the statement is true for the eighth statement\n* Statement: Every Mersenne prime is prime.\n* Proof: Let p be a Mersenne prime. By definition, p is of the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. Since p is prime, it satisfies the definition of a prime number. Therefore, p is prime. Hence, the statement is true.\nStep 10: Check if the statement is true for the final statement\n* Statement: 3 is a Mersenne prime.\n* Proof: Let p = 2^3 - 1. By definition, p is a Mersenne prime if it is of the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. Since 3 is a prime number, p satisfies the definition of a M",

Real numbers are numbers. Every integer is a real number. Every Mersenne prime is prime. 3 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 3 is imaginary.\n\nSolve this problem using a step-by-step approach.[/INST]  Great! Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: Define the terms used in the statement\n* Prime number: A positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1.\n* Natural number: A positive integer greater than 0.\n* Real number: A number that can be represented on the number line.\n* Complex number: A number of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, which satisfies i^2 = -1.\n* Mersenne prime: A prime number of the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number.\nStep 2: Check if the statement is true for the first statement\n* Statement: Each prime number is not composite.\n* Proof: Let p be a prime number. If p is composite, then there exists an integer n such that p = nx, where x is not equal to 1. However, since p is prime, it cannot be divided by any integer except for 1 and itself, so n must be 1 or p. Therefore, p is not composite. Hence, the statement is true.\nStep 3: Check if the statement is true for the second statement\n* Statement: Natural numbers are positive.\n* Proof: Let n be a natural number. By definition, n is a positive integer, so it is positive. Hence, the statement is true.\nStep 4: Check if the statement is true for the third statement\n* Statement: Real numbers are not imaginary.\n* Proof: Imaginary numbers are defined as numbers of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, which satisfies i^2 = -1. Since real numbers are not of this form, they are not imaginary. Hence, the statement is true.\nStep 5: Check if the statement is true for the fourth statement\n* Statement: Prime numbers are natural numbers.\n* Proof: Let p be a prime number. By definition, p is a positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1. Since p is divisible by 1, it is a natural number. Therefore, the statement is true.\nStep 6: Check if the statement is true for the fifth statement\n* Statement: Each Mersenne prime is a prime number.\n* Proof: Let p be a Mersenne prime. By definition, p is of the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. Since p is prime, it satisfies the definition of a prime number. Therefore, p is a prime number. Hence, the statement is true.\nStep 7: Check if the statement is true for the sixth statement\n* Statement: Natural numbers are integers.\n* Proof: Let n be a natural number. By definition, n is a positive integer. Since positive integers are a subset of integers, n is an integer. Hence, the statement is true.\nStep 8: Check if the statement is true for the seventh statement\n* Statement: Every integer is a real number.\n* Proof: Let n be an integer.

By definition, p is a Mersenne prime if it is of the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. Since 3 is a prime number, p satisfies the definition of a M"

Let's break down the statement and use a step-by-step approach to determine whether it is true or false:\n1. Whales are bony (false)\n2. Protostomes are invertebrates (true)\n3. Each painted lady is a butterfly (true)\n4. Every animal is multicellular (true)\n5. Each butterfly is a lepidopteran (true)\n6. Each arthropod is a protostome (true)\n7. Each invertebrate is an animal (true)\n8. Each lepidopteran is an insect (false - lepidopterans are actually a suborder of moths and butterflies, which are not insects)\n9. Insects are arthropods (true)\n10. Each insect is six-legged (true)\n11. Each arthropod is not bony (true)\n\nNow, let's apply these statements to the given word \"Wren\":\n1. Wren is a painted lady (false - Wren is a type of bird, not a butterfly)\n2. Wren is not bony (true)\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Wren is not bony\" is true."

Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: Identify the given statements\n* Tabbies are cats. (True)\n* Mammals are vertebrates. (True)\n* Animals are multicellular. (True)\n* Vertebrates are chordates. (True)\n* Every bilaterian is an animal. (True)\n* Snakes are not furry. (False - snakes are covered in scales, not fur)\n* Cats are felines. (True)\n* Each chordate is a bilaterian. (True)\n* Mammals are furry. (True)\n* Felines are carnivores. (True)\n* Carnivores are carnivorous. (True)\n* Carnivores are mammals. (True)\n\nStep 2: Apply the given statements to the conclusion\nRex is a tabby. (True)\n\nFrom Step 1, we know that tabbies are cats and cats are felines. Therefore, Rex is also a feline.\nNow, we know that felines are carnivores. So, Rex is a carnivore.\nFinally, we know that carnivores are mammals. Therefore, Rex is a mammal.\nConclusion: Rex is a furry mammal.\nSo, the answer to the question \"True or false: Rex is not furry\" is False."

Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: Check if the statement is true for 31.\nWe know that 31 is a Mersenne prime, so it cannot be imaginary. Therefore, the statement \"31 is imaginary\" is false.\nSo, the first statement is true: 31 is not imaginary.\nStep 2: Check if every prime number is prime.\nBy definition, a prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself. Since 31 is a prime number, it satisfies this definition and is therefore prime.\nTherefore, the second statement is true: every prime number is prime.\nStep 3: Check if every natural number is an integer.\nA natural number is defined as a positive integer greater than 0. Since 31 is a natural number, it satisfies this definition and is therefore an integer.\nTherefore, the third statement is true: every natural number is an integer.\nStep 4: Check if each Mersenne prime is a prime number.\nA Mersenne prime is a prime number of the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. Since 31 is a Mersenne prime (specifically, 2^7 - 1), it satisfies this definition and is therefore a prime number.\nTherefore, the fourth statement is true: each Mersenne prime is a prime number.\nStep 5: Check if every natural number is positive.\nThis statement is simply a tautology, as every natural number is indeed positive.\nTherefore, the fifth statement is true: every natural number is positive.\nStep 6: Check if each integer is a real number.\nAn integer is a whole number, either positive, negative, or zero. A real number, on the other hand, is a number that can be represented on the number line. Since integers are a subset of real numbers, we can say that each integer is a real number.\nTherefore, the sixth statement is true: each integer is a real number.\nStep 7: Check if every prime number is a natural number.\nA prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself. Since 31 is a prime number, it satisfies this definition and is therefore a natural number.\nTherefore, the seventh statement is true: every prime number is a natural number.\nStep 8: Check if every real number is not imaginary.\nAn imaginary number is a number of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, which is defined as the square root of -1. Since 31 is a real number, it is not imaginary.\nTherefore, the eighth statement is true: every real number is not imaginary.\nAnd there you have it!

Since Alex is an invertebrate, he is not bony. Therefore, the statement \"Alex is bony\" is False.\nConclusion: The statement \"Alex is bony\" is False based on the given statements and definitions.",

Every prime number is a natural number. 31 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 31 is imaginary.\n\nSolve this problem using a step-by-step approach.[/INST]  Great! Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: Define the terms\nLet's define the terms used in the statement:\n* Real numbers: numbers that can be represented on the number line\n* Imaginary numbers: numbers that can be expressed as a multiple of the imaginary unit i, where i = \u221a(-1)\n* Integers: whole numbers, including zero\n* Prime numbers: numbers that are divisible only by themselves and 1\n* Composite numbers: numbers that are not prime\n* Natural numbers: positive integers, including zero\n* Mersenne primes: prime numbers that are one less than a power of two\n\nStep 2: Identify the given statements\nThe statement provides the following information:\n* Real numbers are not imaginary.\n* Integers are real numbers.\n* Complex numbers are imaginary.\n* Each natural number is an integer.\n* Prime numbers are not composite.\n* Natural numbers are positive.\n* Each Mersenne prime is a prime number.\n* Real numbers are numbers.\n* Mersenne primes are prime.\n* Every prime number is a natural number.\n* 31 is a Mersenne prime.\n\nStep 3: Determine the truth value of each statement\nLet's evaluate each statement to determine its truth value:\n* Statement 1: True, real numbers are not imaginary.\n* Statement 2: True, integers are real numbers.\n* Statement 3: False, complex numbers are not imaginary.\n* Statement 4: True, each natural number is an integer.\n* Statement 5: False, not all prime numbers are composite.\n* Statement 6: True, natural numbers are positive.\n* Statement 7: True, each Mersenne prime is a prime number.\n* Statement 8: True, real numbers are numbers.\n* Statement 9: True, Mersenne primes are prime.\n* Statement 10: True, every prime number is a natural number.\n* Statement 11: True, 31 is a Mersenne prime.\n\nStep 4: Use the truth values to determine the final answer\nNow that we have determined the truth values of each statement, let's use them to determine the final answer:\n* Is 31 imaginary?\nSince statement 11 is true, 31 is a Mersenne prime.\nHowever, statement 3 is false, so 31 is not imaginary.\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nFalse, 31 is not imaginary."

Sam is a butterfly.\nTrue or false: Sam is not bony.\n\nAnswer: <<SYS>>\nYou are an instruction following, problem solving assistant.\n<</SYS>>\n\n[INST]Arthropods are not bony. Every insect is an arthropod. Whales are bony. Butterflies are lepidopterans. Lepidopterans are insects. Every arthropod is an invertebrate. Insects are not eight-legged. Every invertebrate is an animal. Animals are not unicellular. Sam is a butterfly.\nTrue or false: Sam is not bony.\n\nSolve this problem using a step-by-step approach.[/INST]  Great! Let's break down the statements and use a step-by-step approach to determine whether each statement is true or false:\n1. Arthropods are not bony.\nTrue. According to the statement, arthropods are not bony, which means that Sam (a butterfly) cannot be bony. Therefore, the first statement is true.\n2. Every insect is an arthropod.\nTrue. As we have just established, every insect is an arthropod, so this statement is also true.\n3. Whales are bony.\nFalse. According to the statement, whales are bony, which means that they do not fit into the category of arthropods. Therefore, this statement is false.\n4. Butterflies are lepidopterans.\nTrue. As we have already determined, butterflies are indeed lepidopterans, which makes this statement true.\n5. Lepidopterans are insects.\nTrue. Since butterflies are lepidopterans, and lepidopterans are insects, this statement is also true.\n6. Every arthropod is an invertebrate.\nTrue. As arthropods are not bony, they must be invertebrates. Therefore, this statement is true.\n7. Insects are not eight-legged.\nFalse. While some insects may have six legs, others can have more than eight legs. Therefore, this statement is false.\n8. Every invertebrate is an animal.\nTrue. As arthropods are invertebrates, and animals are defined as any living organism that is not a vertebrate, this statement is true.\n9. Animals are not unicellular.\nTrue. Unicellular organisms are not animals, so this statement is true.\n10. Sam is a butterfly.\nTrue. We have already established that butterflies are lepidopterans, and Sam is a butterfly, so this statement is true.\nNow, let's apply these statements to Sam:\nSam is a butterfly (true).\nSam is not bony (false).\nTherefore, the final answer is: False."

Felines are carnivores. Each bilaterian is an animal. Mammals are not cold-blooded. Each animal is not unicellular. Snakes are cold-blooded. Chordates are bilaterians. Vertebrates are chordates. Each carnivore is a mammal. Every mammal is a vertebrate. Cats are felines. Tabbies are cats. Wren is a tabby.\nTrue or false: Wren is not cold-blooded.\n\nSolve this problem using a step-by-step approach.[/INST]  Great! Let's break down the problem into smaller steps and solve it systematically:\nStep 1: Identify the given statements\n* Carnivores are carnivorous. (Given)\n* Felines are carnivores. (Given)\n* Each bilaterian is an animal. (Given)\n* Mammals are not cold-blooded. (Given)\n* Each animal is not unicellular. (Given)\n* Snakes are cold-blooded. (Given)\n* Chordates are bilaterians. (Given)\n* Vertebrates are chordates. (Given)\n* Each carnivore is a mammal. (Given)\n* Every mammal is a vertebrate. (Given)\n* Cats are felines. (Given)\n* Tabbies are cats. (Given)\n* Wren is a tabby. (Given)\n\nStep 2: Identify the question being asked\nThe question being asked is: Is Wren cold-blooded?\n\nStep 3: Use the given statements to answer the question\nWe can use the given statements to determine if Wren is cold-blooded or not. Let's analyze each statement:\n* \"Each bilaterian is an animal.\" - Since Wren is a bilaterian, it is an animal. (True)\n* \"Mammals are not cold-blooded.\" - As Wren is a mammal, it is not cold-blooded. (True)\n* \"Each animal is not unicellular.\" - Unicellular organisms do not exist, so Wren is not unicellular. (True)\n* \"Snakes are cold-blooded.\" - Snakes are cold-blooded, but Wren is not a snake. (False)\n* \"Chordates are bilaterians.\" - Chordates include both bilaterians and non-bilaterians, so Wren could be either. (Not sure)\n* \"Vertebrates are chordates.\" - Vertebrates are a subcategory of chordates, so Wren could be a vertebrate. (Maybe)\n* \"Each carnivore is a mammal.\" - Wren is a tabby, which means it is a carnivore. (True)\n* \"Every mammal is a vertebrate.\" - Since Wren is a mammal, it is a vertebrate. (True)\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that Wren is not cold-blooded. Therefore, the answer to the question is True."

Every lepidopteran is an insect.\n3. Every arthropod is an invertebrate.\n4. Every animal is multicellular.\n5. Each butterfly is a lepidopteran.\n6. Each insect is not eight-legged.\n7. Each whale is bony.\n8. Arthropods are not bony.\nConclusion: Max is not bony.\n\nStep 2: Use the given statements to deduce information about Max.\nFrom statement 5, \"Each butterfly is a lepidopteran,\" we know that Max is a butterfly.\nFrom statement 6, \"Each insect is not eight-legged,\" we know that Max is not eight-legged.\nFrom statement 7, \"Each whale is bony,\" we know that Max is not a whale.\nFrom statement 8, \"Arthropods are not bony,\" we know that Max is not an arthropod.\n\nStep 3: Use the information deduced in Step 2 to conclude whether Max is bony or not.\nSince Max is not a whale, not an arthropod, and not eight-legged, he cannot be bony. Therefore, the conclusion is true: Max is not bony.\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"True or false: Max is not bony?\" is false."

Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: Define the terms used in the statement\n* Natural numbers: Positive integers greater than 0, including 1 and all integers greater than 0.\n* Prime numbers: Positive integers that are divisible only by themselves and 1.\n* Composite numbers: All numbers except for prime numbers.\n* Real numbers: Numbers that can be represented on the number line, including fractions and decimals.\n* Integers: Whole numbers, including negative numbers.\n* Mersenne primes: Prime numbers of the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number.\nStep 2: Check if the statement is true or false\nFor the statement \"31 is real,\" we need to determine whether it is true or false based on our definition of real numbers.\nA real number is defined as a number that can be represented on the number line. Since 31 is a positive integer that can be represented on the number line, it is a real number. Therefore, the statement \"31 is real\" is TRUE.\nStep 3: Use the information provided in the statement to determine whether each statement is true or false\nUsing the information provided in the statement, we can determine whether each statement is true or false:\n* Every prime number is not composite. (TRUE)\n* Real numbers are numbers. (TRUE)\n* Prime numbers are natural numbers. (FALSE - prime numbers can be any integer greater than 0, not just natural numbers)\n* Integers are real numbers. (TRUE)\n* Each Mersenne prime is not composite. (TRUE)\n* Real numbers are real. (TRUE)\n* Each natural number is an integer. (TRUE)\n* Every imaginary number is not real. (TRUE)\n* Each Mersenne prime is a prime number. (TRUE)\nStep 4: Conclude whether the statement is true or false\nBased on our analysis in steps 2 and 3, the statement \"31 is real\" is TRUE, and the remaining statements are either TRUE or FALSE. Therefore, the statement \"Every prime number is not composite\" is TRUE, and the other statements are also TRUE.",

Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: Define the terms used in the statement\n* Real number: A number that can be represented on the number line.\n* Imaginary number: A number that can be expressed as a multiple of the imaginary unit i, where i = \u221a(-1).\n* Prime number: A positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1.\n* Composite number: A positive integer that is divisible by another positive integer other than 1 and itself.\n* Natural number: A positive integer that is greater than 0 and less than or equal to infinity.\n* Mersenne prime: A prime number that is one less than a power of two.\nStep 2: Check if the statement is true or false\nThe statement says \"3 is not imaginary.\" To determine whether this is true or false, we need to check if 3 can be expressed as a linear combination of the imaginary units i and -i.\n3 = 3(1 + 0i) = 3(1 - 0i)\nSince 3 can be expressed as a linear combination of the imaginary units i and -i, it is imaginary. Therefore, the statement \"3 is not imaginary\" is false.\nStep 3: Solve the problem\nNow that we know that the statement \"3 is not imaginary\" is false, we can move on to the next statement: \"Every real number is not imaginary.\"\nTo prove this statement, we can use a proof by contradiction. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that there exists a real number x that is imaginary. Then, x can be expressed as a linear combination of the imaginary units i and -i, such as x = a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.\nHowever, since x is a real number, it must be divisible by 1 and itself. But then, x cannot be expressed as a linear combination of the imaginary units i and -i, since the product of any real number and the imaginary unit i is purely imaginary. This contradicts our assumption that x is imaginary.\nTherefore, our assumption that there exists a real number that is imaginary must be false, and we conclude that every real number is indeed not imaginary.\nSimilarly, we can prove that every integer is a real number, that each prime number is not composite, that every natural number is not negative, and that Mersenne primes are prime. Finally, we can conclude that every natural number is an integer, since every natural number is either an integer or a Mersenne prime.\nTherefore, the statement \"Every real number is not imaginary.

Since 127 is a positive integer, it is either prime or composite.\n2. \"Every Mersenne prime is a prime number.\"\nTrue. A Mersenne prime is a prime number of the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. Since 127 is a Mersenne prime (i.e., 2^3 - 1), it is indeed a prime number.\n3. \"Prime numbers are natural numbers.\"\nFalse.

(True)\n* Mersenne primes are not composite. (True)\n* Each integer is a real number. (True)\n* Natural numbers are integers. (True)\n* Each natural number is positive. (True)\n* Real numbers are numbers. (True)\n* Mersenne primes are prime numbers. (True)\n\nStep 3: Use the given statements to determine the truth value of the conclusion statement\n\nConclusion: 131071 is not real.\n\nTo determine the truth value of the conclusion, we need to use the given statements. Since 131071 is not a real number, it cannot be a natural number, which means it is not a prime number. Therefore, the conclusion is true.\nSo, the answer is: True.",

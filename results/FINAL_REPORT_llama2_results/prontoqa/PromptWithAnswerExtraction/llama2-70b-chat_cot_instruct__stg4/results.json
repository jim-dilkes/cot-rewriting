Each carnivore is carnivorous. Wren is a feline.\nTrue or false: Wren is not furry.\n\nSolve this problem using a step-by-step approach.[/INST]  To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach as follows:\n\n1. Mammals are vertebrates.\n2. Every carnivore is a mammal.\n3. Vertebrates are animals.\n4. Animals are multicellular.\n5. Each snake is not furry.\n6. Each feline is a carnivore.\n7. Cats are felines.\n8. Mammals are furry.\n9. Each carnivore is carnivorous.\n10. Wren is a feline.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statement \"Wren is not furry\" using the given information:\n\n1. Wren is a feline (true).\n2. Felines are carnivores (true).\n3. Carnivores are mammals (true).\n4. Mammals are furry (true).\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Wren is not furry\" is false. Wren, being a feline and a mammal, must be furry."

Every prime number is a natural number.\n\t* 127 is a prime number, so it is a natural number.\n4. Every real number is a number.\n\t* 127 is a real number, so it is a number.\n5. Every real number is not imaginary.\n\t* 127 is a real number, so it is not imaginary.\n6. Complex numbers are imaginary.\n\t* 127 is not a complex number, so it is not imaginary.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"127 is imaginary\" is false."

Premise: Each carnivore is carnivorous.\n6. Premise: Snakes are cold-blooded.\n7. Premise: Mammals are vertebrates.\n8. Premise: Vertebrates are animals.\n9. Premise: Every animal is not unicellular.\n10. Conclusion: Max is a feline.\n\nNow, let's use logical reasoning to determine whether the statement \"Max is not cold-blooded\" is true or false:\n\n1. From premises 3 and 7, we know that mammals are not cold-blooded, and snakes are cold-blooded.\n2. From premise 10, we know that Max is a feline, which means Max is a mammal (since felines are mammals).\n3. Therefore, based on the information above, we can conclude that Max is not cold-blooded.\n\nSo, the answer to the problem is: True. Max is not cold-blooded.",

Integers are real numbers. 3 is a Mersenne prime.\nTrue or false: 3 is not imaginary.\n\nSolve this problem using a step-by-step approach.[/INST]  To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach as follows:\n\n1. Every natural number is not negative.\n\t* True\n2. Every prime number is a natural number.\n\t* True\n3. Prime numbers are prime.\n\t* True\n4. Natural numbers are integers.\n\t* True\n5.

Integers are real numbers.\n\t* True\n11. 3 is a Mersenne prime.\n\t* True\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statement \"3 is not imaginary\" using the given information:\n\n1. 3 is a Mersenne prime.\n2. Mersenne primes are not composite.\n3. Every real number is not imaginary.\n\nSince 3 is a Mersenne prime and Mersenne primes are not composite, we can conclude that 3 is not composite. Moreover, since every real number is not imaginary, we can deduce that 3 is not imaginary. Therefore, the statement \"3 is not imaginary\" is true.\n\nSo, the final answer is: True."

Sally is a cat.\n\nUsing these statements, we can conclude that Sally is a mammal (statement 4) and also a carnivore (statement 3). Therefore, the statement \"Sally is carnivorous\" is true.\n\nSo, the answer is: True."

Every arthropod is an invertebrate.\n2. Every insect is an arthropod.\n3. Butterflies are lepidopterans.\n4. Every lepidopteran is an insect.\n5. Alex is a lepidopteran.\n\nFrom the given statements, we can conclude that Alex is an insect.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statement \"Alex is not small\":\n\n1. Insects are six-legged.\n2. Whales are not small.\n\nFrom the given statements, we cannot conclude whether Alex is small or not. Therefore, the statement \"Alex is not small\" is false."

Is Polly a mammal?\nYes, Polly is a mammal because she is a cat, and cats are mammals.\n2. Are all mammals warm-blooded?\nYes, every mammal is warm-blooded.\n3. Are all warm-blooded animals vertebrates?\nYes, every warm-blooded animal is a vertebrate.\n4. Are all vertebrates animals?\nYes, every vertebrate is an animal.\n5. Are all animals multicellular?\nYes, animals are multicellular.\n6. Are all felines carnivores?\nYes, all felines are carnivores.\n7. Is Polly a carnivore?\nYes, Polly is a carnivore because she is a feline.\n8. Are all carnivores herbivorous?\nNo, every carnivore is not herbivorous.\n9. Is Polly herbivorous?\nNo, Polly is not herbivorous because she is a carnivore.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Polly is herbivorous\" is false."
